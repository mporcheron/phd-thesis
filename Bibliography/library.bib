@article{Balfe2015,
abstract = {This paper describes an experiment that was undertaken to compare three levels of automation in rail signalling; a high level in which an automated agent set routes for trains using timetable information, a medium level in which trains were routed along pre-defined paths, and a low level where the operator (signaller) was responsible for the movement of all trains. These levels are described in terms of a Rail Automation Model based on previous automation theory (Parasuraman etal., 2000). Performance, subjective workload, and signaller activity were measured for each level of automation running under both normal operating conditions and abnormal, or disrupted, conditions. The results indicate that perceived workload, during both normal and disrupted phases of the experiment, decreased as the level of automation increased and performance was most consistent (i.e. showed the least variation between participants) with the highest level of automation. The results give a strong case in favour of automation, particularly in terms of demonstrating the potential for automation to reduce workload, but also suggest much benefit can achieved from a mid-level of automation potentially at a lower cost and complexity.},

When all participants forgo the option to speak, the silence can be called a “lapse.” This article builds on existing work on lapses and other kinds of silences (gaps, pauses, and so on) to examine how participants reach a point where lapsing is a possibility and how they orient to the lapse that subsequently develops. Drawing from a wide range of activities and settings, I will show that participants may treat lapses as (a) the relevant cessation of talk, (b) the allowable development of silence, or (c) the conspicuous absence of talk.

@article{Lavie1995,
abstract = {The early and late selection debate may be resolved if perceptual load of relevant information determines the selective processing of irrelevant information. This hypothesis was tested in 3 studies; all used a variation of the response competition paradigm to measure irrelevant processing when load in the relevant processing was varied. Perceptual load was manipulated by relevant display set size or by different processing requirements for identical displays. These included the requirement to process conjunctions versus isolated features and the requirement to perform simple detection of a character's presence versus difficult identification of its size and position. Distractors' interference was found only under low-load conditions. Because the distractor was usually clearly distinct from the target, it is concluded that physical separation is not a sufficient condition for selective perception; overloading perception is also required. This allows a compromise between early and late selection views and resolves apparent discrepancies in previous work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

We examine a number of challenges from the technical, social, and pragmatic domains that we feel must be overcome before the vision of the smart home, posited by ubiquitous computing research, can become a reality. Our hope in raising these issues is to create a conversation among researchers in the varied disciplines that make up ubiquitous computing. In particular, we hope to raise awareness of the existing literature on the adoption, use, and history of domestic technologies, as well as the use of situated studies, and the benefits that these can bring to bear on the design and evaluation of technologies for the home},

It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective, cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory components, in memory organization, in programming languages, and in input and output equipment.},

However, with the advent of smartphones, an increasing number of users are accessing the mobile Internet via their phone while in more stationary and familiar settings, like at home or at work. This shift in the meaning of mobile is having a signi cant e ect on mobile Web behavior.

As such, the goal of this work is to study this shift and its impact on mobile Internet access, with a view to determining what this means for the future of the mobile Web and in particular mobile search.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Social smoking is increasingly prevalent and poses a challenge to traditional cessation practices. Tobacco companies conducted extensive research on social smokers long before health authorities did and marketed products to promote this smoking behavior. PURPOSE Research is described and mechanisms identified that are used to promote social smoking to help improve cessation strategies in this growing group. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Searches from 2006 to 2008 of previously secret tobacco industry documents using keywords social smoker, light smoker, casual smoker, youth smoker, and occasional smoker, followed by snowball searching. Data analysis was conducted in 2008. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Tobacco industry research identified characteristics of social smokers that include: (1) denial of personal nicotine addiction; (2) self-categorization as a nonsmoker; (3) propensity for decreased tobacco use in response to smoke-free laws; (4) variations in age, education, ethnicity, and socioeconomic backgrounds; and (5) a perceived immunity to personal health effects of tobacco but fear of consequences to others. Tobacco companies developed marketing strategies aimed at social smokers, including “non–habit forming” cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS Previously considered a transient behavior, social smoking is also a stable consumption pattern. Focused clinical questions to detect social smoking are needed and may include, “Have you smoked any cigarettes or used any tobacco products in the past month?” as opposed to “Are you a smoker?” Clinicians should recognize that social smokers might be motivated to quit after education on the dangers of secondhand smoke rather than on personal health risks or with pharmacotherapy.},

abstract = {After many decades of research, the ability to interact with technology through touchless gestures and sensed body movements is becoming an everyday reality. The emergence of Microsoft Kinect, among a host of other related technologies, has had a profound effect on the collective imagination, inspiring and creating new interaction paradigms beyond traditional input mechanisms such as mouse and keyboard. Kinect and other technologies form part of the broader suite of innovations that have come to be characterized as Natural User Interfaces (NUI) (e.g., Widgor and Wixon 2011 and Norman [2011]). This moniker includes not only the vision techniques that form that basis of Kinect, but also natural language interfaces, pen-based input, and multitouch gestural input, amongst techniques. The excitement around touchless and body-based interfaces has been accompanied by an increasingly powerful narrative, one that makes the eponymous claim that these new technologies offer an intuitive interface modality, one that does not require users to develop specialist techniques for communicating to computers. What users need to do, instead, is what comes naturally. Consider, for example, the following quote from Saffer.},

abstract = {? 2016 ACM."Nearby strangers" provides an interestingly paradoxical space for interaction design. There are various social norms, cultural practices, and privacy concerns hindering interaction with nearby strangers, but by ignoring them, people constantly miss social opportunities. Technology enabling ad-hoc interactions between co-located people has been explored for years in research but real-life applications are still rare. The potential focus areas include increasing awareness of social possibilities; light-weight playful interactions, play and gaming; serendipitous and ad hoc social interaction; anonymous exchange of content; matching interests for various purposes; icebreakers and provocation to interact, and ambient representation of the nearby strangers. This workshop convenes researchers and practitioners to gather and advance the state of research on interactions between nearby strangers. We aim to explore this design space and collaboratively identify new research and design opportunities that novel communication technology creates.},

The key aspect of technology use that remains unclear, however, when discussing this paradigm is the complexity of the concept “anytime, anywhere” from the perspective of the user. This paper addresses this gap by discussing findings from an empirical study of freelance workers, across both work and social contexts, in which availability emerged as an important concern for participants. This paper explores the ways in which freelancers use their mobile devices to manage their availability to others. Finally, we also consider implications for the ways in which mobility is conceptualised within the mobile HCI literature.},

abstract = {This article explores whether people more frequently attempt to repair misunderstandings when speaking to an artificial conversational agent if it is represented as fully human. Interactants in dyadic conversations with an agent (the chat bot Cleverbot) spoke to either a text screen interface (agent's responses shown on a screen) or a human body interface (agent's responses vocalized by a human speech shadower via the echoborg method) and were either informed or not informed prior to interlocution that their interlocutor's responses would be agent-generated. Results show that an interactant is less likely to initiate repairs when an agent-interlocutor communicates via a text screen interface as well as when they explicitly know their interlocutor's words to be agent-generated. That is to say, people demonstrate the most "intersubjective effort" toward establishing common ground when they engage an agent under the same social psychological conditions as face-to-face human-human interaction (i.e., when they both encounter another human body and assume that they are speaking to an autonomously-communicating person). This article's methodology presents a novel means of benchmarking intersubjectivity and intersubjective effort in human-agent interaction.},

abstract = {Voice loops, an auditory groupware technology, are essential coordination support tools for experienced practitioners in domains such as air traffic management, aircraft carrier operations and space shuttle mission control. They support synchronous communication on multiple channels among groups of people who are spatially distributed. In this paper, we suggest reasons for why the voice loop system is a successful medium for supporting coordination in space shuttle mission control based on over 130 hours of direct observation. Voice loops allow practitioners to listen in on relevant communications without disrupting their own activities or the activities of others. In addition, the voice loop system is structured around the mission control organization, and therefore directly supports the demands of the domain. By understanding how voice loops meet the particular demands of the mission control environment, insight can be gained for the design of groupware tools to support cooperative activity in other event-driven domains.},

The paper also presents new concepts that can be implemented for business profitability using various IoT Technologies with prime focus on the areas of embedded systems, cyber physical systems, generic sensors and security. In relation to the Retail Industry, the focus areas of development and support of IoT technology will shift from a mere data collection to knowledge creation which can enable value chain development using a framework concentrating more from a legal point of view. Not only has the technology paradigm shifted from a certain POV but businesses also changes in terms of scalability, dynamicity, heterogeneity and interconnectivity.

abstract = {The Think Aloud Protocol (TAP) is a verbalisation technique widely employed in HCI user studies to give insight into user experience, yet little work has explored the impact that TAPs have on participants during user studies. This paper utilises a brain sensing technique, fNIRS, to observe the effect that TAPs have on participants. Functional Near-Infrared Spec- troscopy (fNIRS) is a brain sensing technology that offers the potential to provide continuous, detailed insight into brain activity, enabling an objective view of cognitive processes during complex tasks. Participants were asked to perform a mathematical task under 4 conditions: nonsense verbalisa- tions, passive concurrent think aloud protocol, invasive con- current think aloud protocol, and a baseline of silence. Sub- jective ratings and performance measures were collected dur- ing the study. Our results provide a novel view into the effect that different forms of verbalisation have on workload during tasks. Further, the results provide a means for estimating the effect of spoken artefacts when measuring workload, which is another step towards our goal of proactively involving fNIRS analysis in ecologically valid user studies.},

In this paper, we examine the logs of a commercial search engine's mobile interface, and compare the spoken queries to the typed-in queries. We place special emphasis on the semantic and syntactic characteristics of the two types of queries. We also conduct an empirical evaluation showing that the lan- guage of voice queries is closer to natural language than typed queries.

They cannot even begin to coordinate on content without assuming a vast amount of shared information or common ground—that is, mutual knowledge, mutual beliefs, and mutual assumptions (Clark {\&} Carlson, 1982; Clark {\&} Marshall, 1981; Lewis, 1969; Schelling, 1960).

In face-to-face interaction it can be affected by such matters as the direction of glances (which indicate attention to the speaker by the recipient) and the relationship of the parties to each other. Thus, Goodwin opens for further consideration by interactional analysts the question of what a sentence is by showing that it may not be understandable as a unit apart from the situated occasion of its production. The implications for linguists and others who work with this unit of utterance are manifold.},

Thus, our vantage point is the theoretical framework of distributed cognition.

Although much HCI and CSCW research has explored how we might support collocated, face-to-face situations using mobile devices, much of this work exists as isolated exemplars of technical systems or interaction designs. This paper draws on a range of such exemplars to develop a practical design framework intended for guiding the design of new mobile experiences for collocated interaction as well as analysing existing ones. Our framework provides four relational perspectives for designing the complex interplay between: the social situation in which it takes place; the technology used and the mechanics inscribed; the physical environment; and the temporal elements of design. Moreover, each perspective features some core properties, which are highly relevant when designing these systems. As part of presenting the framework we also explain the process of its construction along with practical advice on how to read and apply it.},

This article argues that this assumption inevitably limits the effectiveness of such practices. Drawing on recent research into cognition as it is manifest in everyday activity, the authors argue that knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose cognitive apprenticeship (Collins, Brown, {\&} Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.},

abstract = {The design of robust interfaces that process conversational speech is a challenging research direc- tion largely because users' spoken language is so variable. This research explored a new dimension of speaker stylistic variation by examining whether users' speech converges systematically with the text-to-speech (TTS) heard from a software partner. To pursue this question, a studywas conducted in which twenty-four 7 to 10-year-old children conversed with animated partners that embodied dif- ferent TTS voices. An analysis of children's amplitude, durational features, and dialogue response latencies confirmed that they spontaneously adapt several basic acoustic-prosodic features of their speech 10–50{\%}, with the largest adaptations involving utterance pause structure and amplitude. Children's speech adaptations were relatively rapid, bidirectional, and dynamically readaptable when introduced to new partners, and generalized across different types of users and TTS voices. Adaptations also occurred consistently, with 70–95{\%} of children converging with their partner's TTS, although individual differences in magnitude of adaptation were evident. In the design of future conversational systems, users' spontaneous convergence could be exploited to guide their speech within system processing bounds, thereby enhancing robustness. Adaptive system process- ing could yield further significant performance gains. The long-term goal of this research is the development of predictive models of human-computer communication to guide the design of new conversational interfaces.},

Using both correlational and experimental methods, we explored whether such interruptions might be causing inattention and hyperactivity — symptoms associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) — even in people not clinically diagnosed with ADHD. We recruited a sample of 221 participants from the general population. For one week, participants were assigned to maximize phone interruptions by keeping notification alerts on and their phones within their reach/sight. During another week, participants were assigned to minimize phone interruptions by keeping alerts off and their phones away. Participants reported higher levels of inattention and hyperactivity when alerts were on than when alerts were off. Higher levels of inattention in turn predicted lower productivity and psychological well- being. These findings highlight some of the costs of ubiquitous connectivity and suggest how people can reduce these costs simply by adjusting existing phone settings},

These orientations to the practical incompatibility between drinking and speaking reveals participants' sensitivities to action modality.},

abstract = {This paper reflects upon the emerging uses of ethnography in engineering and systems design. Although ethnography is often equated simply with fieldwork, a driving force in the early development of classical ethnography was to provide accounts for what is observed in terms of a priori anthropological and sociological theories. Recent studies of collaborative work systems informed by ethnomethodology have exposed the shortcomings of classical ethnography, and have shifted the emphasis of fieldwork towards describing the accountable practices through which those in work constitute and organise their joint activity. However, a second wave of fieldwork-based studies of work systems and design is now gaining force that threatens to dilute this analytic emphasis. Using examples drawn from the production printing industry, I argue that recent examples of scenic fieldwork—fieldwork that merely describes and codifies what relevant persons do in the workplace—may well be missing out on the constitutive practices of how they do what they do, the `interactional what' of their activities. Rather than ethnography, or even fieldwork itself, it is the explication of members' knowledge—what people have to know to do work, and how that knowledge is deployed in the ordering and organisation of work— that provides the key to understanding the contribution of sociology to engineering and design.},

abstract = {Application of design in HCI is a common approach to engendering behavioural change to address important challenges such as sustainability. Encouraging such change requires an understanding of current motivations and behaviours in the domain in question. In this paper, we describe use of wearable cameras to study motivations and behaviours around food consumption by focusing on two contrasting cultures, Malaysia and the UK. Our findings highlight the potential of wearable cameras to enhance knowledge of food consumption practices and identify where and how some digital interventions might be appropriate to change food behaviour. This includes appealing to people's motivations behind food consumption and capitalising on existing practices such as gifting of food and social meals. We propose a food consumption lifecycle as a framework to understand and design human--food interaction. The use of wearable cameras enabled us to capture a high-level overview of spatially distributed food-related practices and understand food behaviours in greater depth.},

For example, it has been argued that they fail to examine the processes through which the phenomena studied have been constituted, and that they lack rigour because they rely upon unexplicated common-sense knowledge. In my view, these criticisms have not been given sufficient attention. This article outlines them in detail and then goes on to provide an evaluation. It is concluded that they do not provide a sufficient basis for the radical-re-specification of the focus of inquiry that ethnomethodologists propose.

@article{Senkowski2008,
abstract = {In a crowded scene we can effectively focus our attention on a specific speaker while largely ignoring sensory inputs from other speakers. How attended speech inputs are extracted from similar competing information has been primarily studied in the auditory domain. Here we examined the deployment of visuo-spatial attention in multiple speaker scenarios. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) were monitored as a real-time index of visual attention towards three competing speakers. Participants were instructed to detect a target syllable by the center speaker and ignore syllables from two flanking speakers. The study incorporated interference trials (syllables from three speakers), no-interference trials (syllable from center speaker only), and periods without speech stimulation in which static faces were presented. An enhancement of flanking speaker induced SSVEP was found 70-220 ms after sound onset over left temporal scalp during interference trials. This enhancement was negatively correlated with the behavioral performance of participants - those who showed largest enhancements had the worst speech recognition performance. Additionally, poorly performing participants exhibited enhanced flanking speaker induced SSVEP over visual scalp during periods without speech stimulation. The present study provides neurophysiologic evidence that the deployment of visuo-spatial attention to flanking speakers interferes with the recognition of multisensory speech signals under noisy environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Twelve subjects (six female) participated in an experiment designed to separate the effects of perceptual/central and physical demands on psychophysiological measures of peripheral nervous system activity. The difficulty of a single-axis continuous manual tracking task was varied in two ways: order of control was manipulated to vary perceptual/central processing demand, and disturbance amplitude was manipulated to vary physical demand. Physiological measures were sensitive to the imposition of a task and were more sensitive to physical than to perceptual/central demands. A principal components analysis identified five factors (three of them physiological) that accounted for 83.1{\%} of the observed variance. Perceptual/central processing demands specifically affected the component identified with sympathetic cardiovascular control, whereas physical demands were reflected in the component identified with parasympathetic cardiovascular control. This finding suggests that dissociations observed among cardiovascular measures in manual performance tasks are attributable to differential activation of the autonomic control systems.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Cognitive engineering needs viable constructs and principles to promote$\backslash$nbetter understanding and prediction of human performance in complex systems.$\backslash$nThree human cognition and performance constructs that have been the subjects of$\backslash$nmuch attention in research and practice over the past three decades are situation$\backslash$nawareness (SA), mental workload, and trust in automation. Recently, Dekker and$\backslash$nWoods (2002) and Dekker and Hollnagel (2004; henceforth DWH) argued that these$\backslash$nconstructs represent “folk models” without strong empirical foundations and lacking$\backslash$nscientific status. We counter this view by presenting a brief description of the large$\backslash$nscience base of empirical studies on these constructs. We show that the constructs$\backslash$ncan be operationalized using behavioral, physiological, and subjective measures,$\backslash$nsupplemented by computational modeling, but that the constructs are also distinct$\backslash$nfrom human performance. DWH also caricatured as “abracadabra” a framework$\backslash$nsuggested by us to address the problem of the design of automated systems$\backslash$n(Parasuraman, Sheridan, {\&} Wickens, 2000). We point to several factual and conceptual$\backslash$nerrors in their description of our approach. Finally, we rebut DWH's view that SA,$\backslash$nmental workload, and trust represent folk concepts that are not falsifiable. We$\backslash$nconclude that SA, mental workload, and trust are viable constructs that are valuable in$\backslash$nunderstanding and predicting human-system performance in complex systems.},

abstract = {Research suggests that ergonomists tend to restrict themselves to two or three of their favorite methods in the design of systems, despite a multitude of variations in the problems that they face. Human Factors and Ergonomics Methods delivers an authoritative and practical account of methods that incorporate human capabilities and limitations, environmental factors, human-machine interaction, and other factors into system design. The Handbook describes 83 methods in a standardized format, promoting the use of methods that may have formerly been unfamiliar to designers.The handbook comprises six sections, each representing a specialized field of ergonomics with a representative selection of associated methods. The sections highlight facets of human factors and ergonomics in systems analysis, design, and evaluation. Sections I through III address individuals and their interactions with the world. Section IV explores social groupings and their interactions (team methods), and Section V examines the effect of the environment on workers. The final section provides an overview of work systems-macroergonomics methods. An onion-layer model frames each method; working from the individual, to the team, to the environment, to the work system. Each chapter begins with an introduction written by the chapter's editor, offering a brief overview of the field and a description of the methods covered. The Handbook provides a representative set of contemporary methods that are valuable in ergonomic analyses and evaluations.The layout of each chapter is standardized for ease-of-use, so you can quickly locate relevant information about each method. Content descriptions are brief, and references are made to other texts, papers, and case studies. Standard descriptions of methods encourage browsing through several potential methods before tackling a problem.},

abstract = {A number of trends in the design of interactive and collaborative systems have resulted in significant attention being paid to the results of "ethnographic fieldwork" and related approaches. Unfortunately, much of the design discussion proceeds with very little understanding of what ethnography is (or might be) and where it came from. In a previous analysis, the author sets out his views on what ethnography is and what it can offer design. In the present paper, the focus is on the antecedents of ethnography and the shape which they have given current explorations. The areas reviewed are the ethnographic traditions of Cultural Anthropology, Sociology of Occupations and Work Practice Analysis. The paper concludes by relating the general themes explored to the previous discussion of the import of ethnography for the design of interactive and collaborative systems.},

@incollection{Brennan1998,
abstract = {(from the chapter) In this chapter I look at human-computer interaction as a kind of coordinated action that bears many similarities to conversational interaction. In human-computer interaction, a computer can be both a medium to communicate through and a partner to communicate with. I consider how people coordinate their activities with other people electronically, over time and distance, as well as how they communicate with computers as interactive partners, regardless of whether the currency of interaction is icons, text, or speech. The problem is that electronic contexts are often impoverished ones. Many of the errors that occur in human-computer interaction can be explained as failures of grounding, in which users and systems lack enough evidence to coordinate their distinct knowledge states. Understanding the grounding process provides not only a systematic framework for interface designers who want to understand and improve human-computer interaction, but also a testbed for cognitive and social psychologists who seek to model the effects of different contexts and media upon language use.},

Here we present a field study and methodology for systematically measuring the monetary value of smartphone battery life, using a reverse second-price sealed-bid auction protocol. Our results show that the prices for the first and last 10{\%} battery segments differ substantially. Our findings also quantify the tradeoffs that users consider in relation to battery, and provide a monetary model that can be used to measure the value of apps and enable fair ad-hoc sharing of smartphone resources.},

@article{Salvucci2008,
abstract = {The authors propose the idea of threaded cognition, an integrated theory of concurrent multitasking--that is, performing 2 or more tasks at once. Threaded cognition posits that streams of thought can be represented as threads of processing coordinated by a serial procedural resource and executed across other available resources (e.g., perceptual and motor resources). The theory specifies a parsimonious mechanism that allows for concurrent execution, resource acquisition, and resolution of resource conflicts, without the need for specialized executive processes. By instantiating this mechanism as a computational model, threaded cognition provides explicit predictions of how multitasking behavior can result in interference, or lack thereof, for a given set of tasks. The authors illustrate the theory in model simulations of several representative domains ranging from simple laboratory tasks such as dual-choice tasks to complex real-world domains such as driving and driver distraction.},

Location-based re-minders (LBRs) provide alarms and notices to users based on their location. These are typically used to remind us to complete a to-do task at a particular location. The current de-sign of LBRs fails to take advantage of prospective memory theory. We hypothesize that if the encoding stage provides a closer match to the retrieval stage, then location recognition and task recall in LBRs will improve at retrieval time. We conducted a between subjects experiment and measured per-formance as location recognition and task recall. We found strong evidence in support that a first-person view benefits prospective remembering the most. We close with a discus-sion of the implications for the design of the encoding stage for future LBR systems.},

@article{Nevile2005,
abstract = {Recorded voice data, such as from cockpit voice recorders (CVRs) or air traffic control tapes, can be an important source of evidence for accident investigation, as well as for human factors research. During accident investigations, the extent of analysis of these recordings depends on the nature and severity of the accident. However, most of the analysis has been based on subjective interpretation rather than the use of systematic methods, particularly when dealing with the analysis of crew interactions. This paper presents a methodology, called conversation analysis, which involves the detailed examination of interaction as it develops moment-to-moment between the participants, in context. Conversation analysis uses highly detailed and revealing transcriptions of recorded voice (or video) data that can allow deeper analyses of how people interact. The paper uses conversation analysis as a technique to examine CVR data from an accident flight. The focus accident was a controlled flight into terrain event involving an Israel Aircraft Industries Westwind 1124 jet aircraft (Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, 1996). The conversation analysis methodology provides a structured means for analysing the crew's interaction. The error that contributed directly to the accident, an incorrectly set minimum descent altitude, can be seen as not the responsibility of one pilot, but at least in part as the outcome of the way the two pilots communicated with one another. The analysis considers the following aspects in particular: the significance of overlapping talk (when both pilots spoke at the same time); the co-pilot's silence after talk from the pilot in command; instances when the pilot in command corrected (repaired) the copilot's talk or conduct; and lastly, a range of aspects for how the two pilots communicated to perform routine tasks. In summary, the conversation analysis methodology shows how specific processes of interaction between crew members helped to create a working environment conducive to making, and not detecting, an error. By not interacting to work together as a team, pilots can create a context for error. When analysing recorded voice data, and especially for understanding instances of human error, often a great deal rests on investigators' or analysts' interpretations of what a pilot said, or what was meant by what was said, or how talk was understood, or how the mood in the cockpit or the pilots' working relationship could best be described. Conversation analysis can be a tool for making such interpretations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

abstract = {We explore the use of shopping lists as an external memory aid to consumers' grocery shopping by examining the factors that influence the content of consumers' shopping lists and the effectiveness of shopping lists as external memory aids. We analyze the shopping lists and actual purchase behavior of a panel of consumers during multiple grocery shopping trips conducted over a 2-month period. Our results indicate that consumers record on their lists approximately 40{\%} of the items they ultimately purchase. Consistent with the external memory literature, we find that consumers write items on their shopping lists for which there are financial incentives to remember (e.g., manufacturers' coupons), need-based incentives to remember (e.g., the product is frequently used), and schema-based advantages to remember (e.g., items purchased on fill-in trips). More than 80{\%} of the items written on the shopping list were actually purchased. Thus, shopping lists appear to be an effective external memory storage device for grocery purchasing. We discuss these and other findings in relation to the literatures on external memory and planned versus unplanned purchasing.},

abstract = {The focus of user interface research and development has evolved over the past forty years. The term ''user interface'' was not used at first, when most users were engineers and programmers; it may again become inappropriate when more applications are designed for groups than for individuals. But there is a continuity to the outward movement of the computer's interface to its external environment, from hardware to software to increasingly higher-level cognitive capabilities and finally to social processes. As the focus shifts, the approaches to design and the skills required of practitioners changes. This paper identifies five foci of interface development. Research and development foci may be independent, and progress in one area may influence others, so a comprehensive framework may help position existing research and development efforts and plan future work more eflectively.},

The new ways of working afforded by these technologies are often characterised in terms of access to information and people ‘anytime, anywhere'. This paper presents a study of mobile workers that highlights different facets of access to remote people and information, and different facets of anytime, anywhere. Four key factors in mobile work are identified from the study: the role of planning, working in ‘dead time', accessing remote technological and informational resources, and monitoring the activities of remote colleagues. By reflecting on these issues, we can better understand the role of technology and artefact use in mobile work and identify the opportunities for the development of appropriate technological solutions to support mobile workers.},

abstract = {Effective management of documents on computers has been a central user interface problem for many years. One common approach involves using 2D spatial layouts of icons representing the documents, particularly for in- formation workspace tasks. This approach takes advan- tage of human 2D spatial cognition. More recently, sev- eral 3D spatial layouts have engaged 3D spatial cognition capabilities. Some have attempted to use spatial memory in 3D virtual environments. However, there has been no proof to date that spatial memory works the same way in 3D virtual environments as it does in the real world. We describe a new technique for document management called the Data Mountain, which allows users to place documents at arbitrary positions on an inclined plane in a 3D desktop virtual environment using a simple 2D inter- action technique. We discuss how the design evolved in response to user feedback. We also describe a user study that shows that the Data Mountain does take advantage of spatial memory. Our study shows that the Data Mountain has statistically reliable advantages over the Microsoft Internet Explorer Favorites mechanism for managing documents of interest in an information workspace.},

To meet simultaneous requirements of mobility and control, centers of coordination must function as centers to which participants distributed in space can orient, and which at any given moment they know how to find. At the same time, to coordinate activities distributed in space and time personnel within the site must somehow have access to the situation of co-workers in other locations. One job of technologies in such settings is to meet these requirements through the reconfiguration of relevant spatial and temporal relations. This general characterization is explored through ethnographic materials from an investigation of the work of airline ground operations at a metropolitan airport on the west coast of the United States.},

Through an interview and diary study, we discover how the smart phone is used in pragmatic and seamful ways, regardless of the interface of the specific phone selected or the particular features available. Users used phones in highly individual manners; mixed and adapted existing functions to meet their own priorities; added some functions and ignored others to create their own portfolio; and blended their use with the specifics of their everyday lives. While these data challenge some assumptions of human--computer interaction and ubiquitous computing, it also presents new research potential in terms of understanding how users take advantage of the multiple features in smart phone devices and how they utilize seamfulness in everyday smart phones practices.},

Distributed Cognition has been proposed as a framework for understanding the design and use of medical devices. However, it is not clear that it has the analytic apparatus to support the investigation of such complexities. This paper proposes a framework that introduces concentric layers to DiCoT, a method that facilitates the application of Distributed Cognition theory. We use this to explore how an inpatient blood glucose meter is coupled with its context. The analysis is based on an observational study of clinicians using a newly introduced glucometer on an oncology ward over approximately 150. h (11. days and 4 nights). Using the framework we describe the basic mechanics of the system, incremental design considerations, and larger design considerations. The DiCoT concentric layers (DiCoT-CL) framework shows promise for analyzing the design and use of medical devices, and how they are coupled with their context.},

In this paper, the relationship between workload and speech is discussed, and two studies are reported. In the first study, time-stress is considered. In the second study, dual-task performance is considered. Both studies show workload to significantly reduce recognition accuracy and user performance. The nature of the impairment is shown to differ between individuals and types of workload. Furthermore, it appears that workload affects the selection of words to use, the articulation of the words and the relationship between speaking to ASR and performing other tasks. It is proposed that speaking to ASR is, in itself, demanding and that as workload increases so the ability to perform the task within the limits required by ASR suffers.

Increasingly, we are also seeing these ideas applied to critique and inform HCI design more generally. However, the attempt to design from the basis of ethnomethodology is fraught with methodological dangers. In particular, ethnomethodology's overriding concern with the detail of practice poses some serious problems when attempts are made to design around such understandings. In this paper, we discuss the range and application of eth- nomethodological investigations of technology in working settings, describe how ethnomethodologically-affiliated work has approached system design and discuss ways that ethnomethodology can move from design critique to design practice: the advent of technomethodology.},

abstract = {This paper reports a series of investigations, which aim to test the appropriateness of voice recognition as an interaction method for mobile phone use. First, a KLM model was used in order to compare the speed of using voice recognition against using multi-tap and predictive text (the two most common methods of text entry) to interact with the phone menus and compose a text message. The results showed that speech is faster than the other two methods and that a combination of input methods provides the quickest task completion times. The first experiment used a controlled message creation task to validate the KLM predictions. This experiment also confirmed that the result was not due to a speed/accuracy trade off and that participants preferred to use the combination of input methods rather than a single method for menu interaction and text composition. The second experiment investigated the effect of limited visual feedback (when walking down the road or driving a car for example) on interaction, providing further evidence in support of speech as a useful input method. These experiments not only indicate the usefulness of voice in SMS input but also that users could also be satisfied with voice input in hands-busy, eyes-busy situations.},

Several user activities were held to understand the experience of investment decisions, the opportunities to design financial cognitive advisers, and the user perceptions of such systems. Valuable information was gathered from four user studies which assisted the project team to decide what would be the best approach to help people to make more informed decisions about investments using technology. The user studies findings highlighted that financial decisions are made based on information people receive from friends, news, and social networks, which led us to explore intelligent systems that would gather such information and play the role of financial advisers in a multiparty conversational system. We discuss the main design implications of our studies in the context of a prototype called CognIA and conclude discussing several challenges of designing conversational systems.},

However, the mobile Internet represents a challenging information access platform due to the inherent limitations of mobile environments, limitations that go beyond simple screen size and network issues. Mobile users often have information needs which are impacted by contexts such as location and time. Furthermore, human beings are social creatures that often seek out new strategies for sharing knowledge and information in mobile settings. To investigate the social aspect of mobile search, we have developed SocialSearchBrowser (SSB), a novel proof-of-concept interface that incorporates social networking capabilities with key mobile contexts to improve the search and information discovery experience of mobile users. In this paper, we present the results of an exploratory field study of SSB and outline key implications for the design of next generation mobile information access services.},

When linked to environmental performance, the broader concept of best practice environmental management is of direct relevance to tourism. There is growing evidence that the tourism industry is prepared to foster environmental excellence through the adoption of best practice environmental management, and the implementation of self-regulatory auditing procedures to monitor compliance with environmental standards. This trend, which is strongest at the international corporate level of the tourism industry, is being reflected in the ‘greening' of major elements of Australian tourism. The challenge is to raise concern for the environment among the many smaller, disparate tourism operations, and to promote best practice environmental management at all levels of the tourism industry.},

We explore breakpoint-based notification management, in which the smartphone defers notifications until an opportune moment. With a video survey where participants selected ap-propriate moments for notifications from a video-recorded social interaction, we identify four breakpoint types: long silence, a user leaving the table, others using smartphones, and a user left alone. We introduce a Social Context-Aware smartphone Notification system, SCAN, that uses built-in sensors to detect social context and identifies breakpoints to defer smartphone notifications until a breakpoint. We con-ducted a controlled study with ten friend groups who had SCAN installed on their smartphones while dining at a restau-rant. Results show that SCAN accurately detects break-points (precision=92.0{\%}, recall=82.5{\%}), and reduces noti-fication interruptions by 54.1{\%}. Most participants reported that SCAN helped them to focus better on in-person social interaction and found selected breakpoints appropriate.},

BACKGROUND:I describe the discoveries and developments regarding multiple resource theory that have emerged over the past 50 years that contribute to performance and workload prediction. METHOD:The article presents a history of the multiple resource concept, a computational version of the multiple resource model applied to multitask driving simulation data, and the relation of multiple resources to workload. RESULTS:Research revealed the importance of the four dimensions in accounting for task interference and the association of resources with brain structure. Multiple resource models yielded high correlations between model predictions and data. Lower correlations also identified the existence of additional resources. CONCLUSION:The model was shown to be partially relevant to the concept of mental workload, with greatest relevance to performance breakdowns related to dual-task overload. Future challenges are identified. APPLICATION:The most important application of the multiple resource model is to recommend design changes when conditions of multitask resource overload exist.},

abstract = {Researchers who analyse smartphone usage logs often make the assumption that users who lock and unlock their phone for brief periods of time (e.g., less than a minute) are continuing the same “session” of interaction. However, this assumption is not empirically validated, and in fact different studies apply different arbitrary thresholds in their analysis. To validate this assumption, we conducted a field study where we collected user-labelled activity data through ESM and sensor logging. Our results indicate that for the majority of instances where users return to their smartphone, i.e., unlock their device, they in fact begin a new session as opposed to continuing a previous one. Our findings suggest that the commonly used approach of ignoring brief standby periods is not reliable, but optimisation is possible. We therefore propose various metrics related to usage sessions and evaluate various machine},

abstract = {Even the interaction between technology and healthcare has a long history, the embracing of e-health is slow because of limited infrastructural arrangements, capacity and political willingness. Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to usher in the biggest and fastest spread of technology in history, therefore together with e-health will completely modify person-to-person, human-to-machine and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications for the benefit of society in general. It is anticipated that the IoT-based e-health solutions will revolutionize the healthcare industry like nothing else before it. The rapid growth of IoT, Cloud computing and Big data, as well as the proliferation and widespread adoption of new technologies and miniature sensing device, have brought forth new opportunities to change the way patients and their healthcare providers manage health conditions, thus improving human health and well-being. The integration of IoT into the healthcare system brings numerous advantages, such as the availability and accessibility, the ability to provide a more ``personalized'' system, and high-quality cost-effective healthcare delivery. Still, the success of the IoT-based e-health systems will depend on barriers needed to overcome in order to achieve large-scale adoption of e-health applications. A large number of significant technological improvements in both hardware and software components are required to develop consistent, safe, effective, timely, flexible, patient-centered, power-efficient and ubiquitous healthcare systems. However, trust, privacy and security concerns, as well as regulation issues, identification, and semantic interoperability are pivotal in the widespread adoption of IoT and e-health together. Therefore, developing a climate of trust is one of the most important tasks that must be accomplished for successful e-health implementations. This chapter analyzes the ideas and impacts of IoT on the design of new e-health solutions and identifies the majority of challenges that determine successful IoT-based e-health system adoption.},

abstract = {Robots that work with people foster social relationships between people and systems. The home is an interesting place to study the adoption and use of these systems. The home provides challenges from both technical and interaction perspectives. In addition, the home is a seat for many specialized human behaviors and needs, and has a long history of what is collected and used to functionally, aesthetically, and symbolically fit the home. To understand the social impact of robotic technologies, this paper presents an ethnographic study of consumer robots in the home. Six families' experience of floor cleaning after receiving a new vacuum (a Roomba robotic vacuum or the Flair, a handheld upright) was studied. While the Flair had little impact, the Roomba changed people, cleaning activities, and other product use. In addition, people described the Roomba in aesthetic and social terms. The results of this study, while initial, generate implications for how robots should be designed for the home.},

@article{Simon1981,
abstract = {Cognitive science is, of course, not really a new discipline, but a recognition of a fundamental set of common concerns shared by the disciplines of psychology, computer science, linguistics, economics, epistemology, and the social sciences generally. All of these disciplines are concerned with information processing systems, and all of them are concerned with systems that are adaptive-that are what they are from being ground between the nether millstone of their physiology or hardware, as the case may be, and the upper millstone of a complex environment in which they exist. Systems that are adaptive may equally well be described as "artificial," for as environments change, they can be expected to change too, as though they were deliberately designed to fit those environments (as indeed they sometimes are). The task of empirical science is to discover and verify invariants in the phenomena under study. The artificiality of information processing systems creates a subtle problem in defining empirical invariants in such systems. For observed regularities are very likely invariant only within a limited range of variation in their environments, and any accurate statement of the laws of such systems must contain reference to their relativity to environmental features. It is a common experience in experimental psychology, for example, to discover that we are studying sociology-the effects of the past histories of our subjects-when we think we are studying physiology-the effects of properties of the human nervous system. Similarly, business cycle economists are only now becoming aware of the extent to which the parameters of the system they are studying are dependent on the experiences of a population with economic events over the previous generation. In artificial sciences, the descriptive and the normative are never far apart. Thus, in economics, the "principle of rationality" is sometimes asserted as a descriptive invariant, sometimes as advice to decision makers. Similarly, in psychology, the processes of adaptation (learning) have always been a central topic, at one time a topic that dominated the whole field of research. Linguistics, too, has suffered its confusions between descriptive and normative attitudes towards its subject. But we must avoid the error, in studying information processing systems, of thinking that the adaptive processes themselves must be invariant; and we must be prepared to face the complexities of regression in the possibility that they themselves may be subject to improvement and adaptation. It might have been necessary a decade ago to argue for the commonality of the information processes that are employed by such disparate systems as computers and human nervous systems. The evidence for that commonality is now overwhelming, and the remaining questions about the boundaries of cognitive science have more to do with whether there also exist nontrivial commonalities with information processing in genetic systems than with whether men and machines both think. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

abstract = {The article investigates a multimodal practice for self-selecting observed in a video-taped corpus of work meetings: the use of pointing gestures predicting possible turn completions and projecting the emergence of possible next speakers. This practice is analyzed in various sequential positions, namely at turn beginnings and at pre-beginnings. It displays recipients' practical online turn parsing, and their orientation to transition spaces, and to TCU, completions in a visible, recognizable, public way. It shows the emergent and progressive establishment of speakership, exploiting both systematic features of turn-taking and specific features of the interactional space. The article explores the emic, locally situated and contingent definition of speakership by considering not only where pointing gestures begin but also where they end: pointing does not only end in pre-completion positions, projecting turn end, but can also persist through sequences, showing speaker's orientations to her turn's sequential implicativeness. Thus, by observing a particular multimodal practice within a specific interactional setting, the article explores participants' orientations to the rights and obligations associated with talk-related categories such as 'non current speaker', 'possible next speaker', 'incipient speaker' and 'current speaker'.

Attention is drawn to the centrality of sequentiality as part of the orderly properties of occasioned places. As part of examining the sequences I chart the ongoing emergence of features of breakfast time in the caf{\'{e}} such as ‘the first customer', ‘crowded' and ‘quiet'.

abstract = {Social awareness applications are based on the idea of a group sharing real-time context information via personal and ubiquitous terminals. Studies of such appli- cations have shown that users are not only concerned with the preservation privacy through non-disclosure. Instead, disclosure is manipulated for the constant presentation of self to the group in everyday social situations. Basing on 3 years of research with the mobile social awareness sys- tem ContextContacts, established findings in social psychology and ubiquitous computing, we propose a number of design principles to support users in this man- agement of privacy and presentation. These principles are to apply even if disclosure is automated, and include sup- port for lightweight permissions, assuming reciprocity, appearing differently to different audiences, providing for feedback on presentation and allowing lying. These prin- ciples are applied in interaction design and protocol engineering for the next version of a mobile awareness system called ContextContacts.},

@book{Pieraccini2012,
abstract = {Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey famously featured HAL, a computer with the ability to hold lengthy conversations with his fellow space travelers. More than forty years later, we have advanced computer technology that Kubrick never imagined, but we do not have computers that talk and understand speech as HAL did. Is it a failure of our technology that we have not gotten much further than an automated voice that tells us to "say or press 1"? Or is there something fundamental in human language and speech that we do not yet understand deeply enough to be able to replicate in a computer? In The Voice in the Machine, Roberto Pieraccini examines six decades of work in science and technology to develop computers that can interact with humans using speech and the industry that has arisen around the quest for these technologies. He shows that although the computers today that understand speech may not have HAL's capacity for conversation, they have capabilities that make them usable in many applications today and are on a fast track of improvement and innovation. Pieraccini describes the evolution of speech recognition and speech understanding processes from waveform methods to artificial intelligence approaches to statistical learning and modeling of human speech based on a rigorous mathematical model -- specifically, Hidden Markov Models (HMM). He details the development of dialog systems, the ability to produce speech, and the process of bringing talking machines to the market. Finally, he asks a question that only the future can answer: will we end up with HAL-like computers or something completely unexpected?},

@book{Hutchins1995,
abstract = {Edwin Hutchins combines his background as an anthropologist and an open ocean racing sailor and navigator in this account of how anthropological methods can be combined with cognitive theory to produce a new reading of cognitive science. His theoretical insights are grounded in an extended analysis of ship navigation - its computational basis, its historical roots, its social organization, and the details of its implementation in actual practice aboard large ships. The result is an unusual interdisciplinary approach to cognition in culturally constituted activities outside the laboratory - "in the wild." Hutchins examines a set of phenomena that have fallen in the cracks between the established disciplines of psychology and anthropology, bringing to light a new set of relationships between culture and cognition. The standard view is that culture affects the cognition of individuals. Hutchins argues instead that cultural activity systems have cognitive properties of their own that are different from the cognitive properties of the individuals who participate in them. Each action for bringing a large naval vessel into port, for example, is informed by culture: the navigation team can be seen as a cognitive and computational system. Introducing Navy life and work on the bridge, Hutchins makes a clear distinction between the cognitive properties of an individual and the cognitive properties of a system. In striking contrast to the usual laboratory tasks of research in cognitive science, he applies the principal metaphor of cognitive science - cognition as computation (adopting David Marr's paradigm) - to the navigation task. After comparing modern Western navigation with the method practiced in Micronesia, Hutchins explores the computational and cognitive properties of systems that are larger than an individual. He then turns to an analysis of learning or change in the organization of cognitive systems at several scales. Hutchins's conclusion illustrates the costs of ignoring the cultural nature of cognition, pointing to the ways in which contemporary cognitive science can be transformed by new meanings and interpretations.},

@article{Luff2018,
abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of large-scale centers of command and control that bring together a range of personnel from various services responsible for the management of day-to-day incidents and events. These multicenter control rooms stand in marked contrast to what Suchman termed ‘centers of coordination' (Suchman 1997), which have typically formed the focus of much research within HCI and Computer supported co-operative work (CSCW). In this paper, we explore the practices and technical resources within one of these very large multicenter control rooms. Staff in this control room do collaborate with colleagues who are copresent, but there is little reliance on the subtle interactional practices found in earlier studies. However, one information system is critical for collaboration and managing incidents that arise: the information system that is used to record incidents. Unlike in previous settings where records were made after an incident had taken place, these records are used for the concurrent management of activities. We consider the practices through which staff assemble these records to serve the demands of different individuals, with differing responsibilities in various organizations within the control room. We consider instances of copresent collaboration and suggest that these are often to ameliorate problems with the records rather than supporting real-time colocated activities. Although staff may be copresent in these multicenter control rooms, they have different kinds of technological resources available to them, and a different ‘division of labor.' This can undermine the integration of these resources within forms of work. We conclude by discussing the implications for our understanding of copresent work and also for the methods and approaches we can draw upon for understanding these contemporary workplaces.},

Smartwatches are gaining popularity, yet little is known about the user experience and their impact on our increasingly always online culture. We report on a qualitative study with existing users on their everyday use of smartwatches to understand both the added value and the challenges of being constantly connected at the wrist. Our findings show that users see a large benefit in receiving notifications on their wrist, especially in terms of helping manage expectations of availability. Moreover, we find that response rates after viewing a notification on a smartwatch change based on the other devices available: laptops prompt quicker replies than smartphones. Finally, there are still many costs associated with using smartwatch-es, thus we make a series of design recommendations to improve the user experience of smartwatches.},

abstract = {"Shaping Things is about created objects and the environment, which is to say, it's about everything," writes Bruce Sterling in this addition to the Mediawork Pamphlet series. He adds, "Seen from sufficient distance, this is a small topic." Sterling offers a brilliant, often hilarious history of shaped things. We have moved from an age of artifacts, made by hand, through complex machines, to the current era of "gizmos." New forms of design and manufacture are appearing that lack historical precedent, he writes; but the production methods, using archaic forms of energy and materials that are finite and toxic, are not sustainable. The future will see a new kind of objectwe have the primitive forms of them now in our pockets and briefcases: user-alterable, baroquely multi-featured, and programmablethat will be sustainable, enhanceable, and uniquely identifiable. Sterling coins the term "spime" for them, these future manufactured objects with informational support so extensive and rich that they are regarded as material instantiations of an immaterial system. Spimes are designed on screens, fabricated by digital means, and precisely tracked through space and time. They are made of substances that can be folded back into the production stream of future spimes, challenging all of us to become involved in their production. Spimes are coming, says Sterling. We will need these objects in order to live; we won't be able to surrender their advantages without awful consequences. The vision of Shaping Things is given material form by the intricate design of Lorraine Wild. Shaping Things is for designers and thinkers, engineers and scientists, entrepreneurs and financiersand anyone who wants to understand and be part of the process of technosocial transformation.},

@article{Crabtree2005,
abstract = {The field of CSCW research emerged with the development of distributed computing systems and attempts to understand the socially organized ('collaborative' or 'cooperative') nature of work in order to embed such systems in the workplace. As a field of interdisciplinary inquiry CSCW was motivated by technological developments and the need to understand the particular contexts within which those developments were intended to resonate. In other words, it is no mere accident that CSCW took work as its topic and resource - the historical nature of IT research from which the field emerged meant that for all practical purposes it could not be otherwise. Yet times change. IT research moves on. Today mobile, ambient, pervasive, ubiquitous, mixed reality and wearable computing, et cetera, are of fundamental concern to the contemporary computing research community. Furthermore, these developments are accompanied by a movement away from the workplace to focus on diverse settings in everyday life: homes, games, museums, photography, tourism, performances, indeed diverse bodies of people and pursuits that generally fall under the conceptual rubric of the 'ludic'. Accompanying this shift away from work is a call for new approaches and concepts that will enable researchers to better understand the ludic and inform design appropriately. In this paper we seek to address the boundaries of CSCW and the ability of CSCW to respond to contemporary research agendas. We present an ethnomethodological study of a location-based mixed reality game to demonstrate the continued relevance of CSCW approaches and concepts to contemporary agendas in IT research. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are becoming ubiquitously available, being embedded both into everyday mobility via smartphones, and into the life of the home via ‘assistant' devices. Yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. By collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the Amazon Echo in participants' homes—informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis—our study documents the methodical practices of VUI users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. Data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. We discuss how the VUI is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. Finally, we locate implications for the accountability of VUI interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing ‘conversational' interfaces.},

We employed both quantitative measures such as computer log data and ethnographic methods to compare a baseline condition (normal email usage) with our experimental manipulation (email cutoff). Our results show that without email, people multitasked less and had a longer task focus, as measured by a lower frequency of shifting between windows and a longer duration of time spent working in each computer window. Further, we directly measured stress using wearable heart rate monitors and found that stress, as measured by heart rate variability, was lower without email. Interview data were consistent with our quantitative measures, as participants reported being able to focus more on their tasks. We discuss the implications for managing email better in organizations.},

We also eliminate the need to press a TALK button to answer an incoming call by recognizing if the user picks up the phone and listens to it.},

abstract = {Context-awareness is a maturing area within the field of ubiquitous computing. It is particularly relevant to the growing sub-field of mobile com- puting as a user's context changes more rapidly when a user is mobile, and interacts with more devices and people in a greater number of loca- tions. In this chapter, we present a definition of context and context-awareness and describe its importance to human-computer interaction and mobile computing. We describe some of the dif- ficulties in building context-aware applications and the solutions that have arisen to address these. Despite these solutions, users have difficulties in using and adopting mobile context-aware applica- tions. We discuss these difficulties and present a set of eight design guidelines that can aid application designers in producing more usable and useful mobile context-aware applications.},

abstract = {Synchronous colocated collaborative sensemaking requires that analysts share their information and insights with each other. The challenge is to know when is the right time to share what information without disrupting the present state of analysis. This is crucial in ad-hoc sensemaking sessions with mobile devices because small screen space limits information display. To address these tensions, we propose and evaluate RAMPARTS—a spatially aware sensemaking system for col-laborative crime analysis that aims to support faster informa-tion sharing, clue-finding, and analysis. We compare RAM-PARTS to an interactive tabletop and a paper-based method in a controlled laboratory study. We found that RAMPARTS significantly decreased task completion time compared to pa-per, without affecting cognitive load or task completion time adversely compared to an interactive tabletop. We conclude that designing for ad-hoc colocated sensemaking on mobile devices could benefit from spatial awareness. In particular, spatial awareness could be used to identify relevant informa-tion, support diverse alignment styles for visual comparison, and enable alternative rhythms of sensemaking.},

It draws on ideas from Contextual Design, but re-orients them towards the principles that are central to Distributed Cognition. When used to reason about possible changes to the design of a system, it also draws on Claims Analysis to reason about the likely effects of changes from a Distributed Cognition perspective. The approach has been developed and tested within a large, busy ambulance control centre. It supports reasoning about both existing system design and possible future designs.},

In this paper, we present an experiment aimed at evaluating whether gaze directional cues of users could be used for this purpose. Using an eye tracker, we measured subject gaze at the faces of conversational partners during four-person conversations. Results indicate that when someone is listening or speaking to individuals, there is indeed a high probability that the person looked at is the person listened (p=88{\%}) or spoken to (p=77{\%}). We conclude that gaze is an excellent predictor of conversational attention in multiparty conversations. As such, it may form a reliable source of input for conversational systems that need to establish whom the user is speaking or listening to. We implemented our findings in FRED, a multi-agent conversational system that uses eye input to gauge which agent the user is listening or speaking to.},

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls "embodied interaction"an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationalityreflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.},

abstract = {Previous research on dyadic interaction indicates that cross-sex conversations (male-female) are characterized by more frequent interruptions than same-sex conversations and that males consistently tend to interrupt their female coconversationalists. Perceptions of conversational rule-breaking were examined in 3 samples of 36 male and 62 female undergraduates, 37 male and 70 female undergraduates, and 34 male and 69 female undergraduates. Ss indicated their perceptions of the distribution of interruptions in cross-sex conversations and reported what types of conversations in which they expected interruptions most frequently. Findings suggest that normative definitions reflected in perceptions of interruption are inconsistent with the empirical distribution of rule-breaking observed by conversational researchers. This misperception of rule-breaking seems to hinge on the relational property of power. Possible explanations for the incongruity between the objective patterning and social definition of conversational rule-breaking are explored, and implications of this misperception for sociological theorizing on deviance are discussed. It is suggested that these results provide some strategic insights into the problematic distinction between deviance and rule-breaking that has been central to labeling theory.},

The method provides additional channels to EEG-based methods (e.g., [8]) for the study of user attention and emotions. In order to validate the proposed approach, two tour guide applications were created with an embodied conversational agent (ECA) that presents cultural content about a real-tourist attraction. The agent simulates two attention-grabbing mechanisms - humorous and serious to attract the users' attention. A formal study was conducted to compare two tour guide applications in the lab. The data collected from the facial xpression analysis and eye-tracking helped to explain particularly good and bad performances in retention tests. In terms of the study results, strong quantitative and qualitative evidence was found that an ECA should not attract more attention to itself than necessary, to avoid becoming a distraction from the flow of the content. It was also found that the ECA had an inverse effect on the retention performance of participants with different gender and their use on computer interfaces is not a good idea for elderly users. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

To improve focus we designed meTime, a real-time awareness application that shows users how they allocate their time across applications. In two real-world deployments involving 118 participants, we examined whether greater awareness of time use improves focus. In our first deployment, we provided awareness information using meTime, to both office workers and students. Exposure to meTime reduced use of social media, email, browsing and total time online. However increased awareness didn't affect time spent in productivity applications. A second educational deployment largely replicated these results and showed that meTime also reduced users' perceptions of their ability to focus effectively. Changed perceptions were associated with higher class grades. We discuss practical and theoretical implications as well as design principles for use of time applications.},

A qualitative analysis of the use processes shows how users turned the functionalities embodied in Comeks into particular resources for commu- nication during the 9-week trial period. The paper discusses the relationship of functionalities of the artifact and the de- velopment of resources by presenting how functionalities can be designed to support three ways to appropriate com- munication technologies: increasing technical mastery, re- channeling existing communication into the new medium and inventing new communicative acts between users.},

In a two-week in-The-wild study, we collected over 40,000,000 usage logs and 4398 boredom self-reports of 54 mobile phone users. We show that a user-independent machine-learning model of boredom -leveraging features related to recency of communication, usage intensity, time of day, and demographics- can infer boredom with an accuracy (AUCROC) of up to 82.9{\%}. Results from a second field study with 16 participants suggest that people are more likely to engage with recommended content when they are bored, as inferred by our boredom-detection model. These findings enable boredom-Triggered proactive recommender systems that attune their users' level of attention and need for stimulation. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 ACM.},

We found that the response time and the perceived disruption from a notification can be influenced by its presentation, alert type, sender-recipient re-lationship as well as the type, completion level and complex-ity of the task in which the user is engaged. We found that even a notification that contains important or useful content can cause disruption. Finally, we observe the substantial role of the psychological traits of the individuals on the response time and the disruption perceived from a notification.},

abstract = {ISSN: 0835-1813 (Print) 1532-7973 (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/hrls20 ABSTRACT This article examines how participants in face-to-face conversation employ mobile phones as a resource for social action. We focus on what we call mobile-supported sharing activities, in which participants use a mobile phone to share text or images with others by voicing text aloud from their mobile or providing others with visual access to the device's display screen. Drawing from naturalistic video recordings, we focus on how mobile-supported sharing activities invite assessments by providing access to an object that is not locally accessible to the participants. Such practices make relevant coparticipants' assessment of these objects and allow for different forms of coparticipation across sequence types. We additionally examine how the organization of assessments during these sharing activ-ities displays sensitivity to preference structure. The analysis illustrates the relevance of embodiment, local objects, and new communicative technol-ogies to the production of action in copresent interaction. Data are in American English. In this article, we examine one practice for providing epistemic access to an assessable referent: introducing it into the talk using a mobile phone. We focus on the interactional relevance of participants using these devices to share text and images with copresent others, whether by reading (or " voicing ") text aloud from their mobile phone or providing cointeractants with visual access to the device's display screen. The analysis considers one such function of these mobile-supported sharing activities, in which they invite assessments by providing coparticipants with sufficient knowledge (Pomerantz, 1984) to evaluate the item being shared. Such practices highlight the ways in which the technological affordances (Gibson, 1977; Hutchby, 2001) of modern-day mobile phones—in particular, the immediate accessibility they provide to digital photographs and records of prior text message exchanges—are employed in concert with other semiotic resources to support the production of social action. In the context of everyday interaction, the sharing of these texts and images is a joint activity that allows participants to share direct epistemic access to an otherwise inaccessible referent and provides opportunities for collaborative assessments of this referent.},

abstract = {Spoken dialogue systems allow users to interact with computer-based applications such as databases and expert systems by using natural spoken language. The origins of spoken dialogue systems can be traced back to Artificial Intelligence research in the 1950s concerned with developing conversational interfaces. However, it is only within the last decade or so, with major advances in speech technology, that large-scale working systems have been developed and, in some cases, introduced into commercial environments. As a result many major telecommunications and software companies have become aware of the potential for spoken dialogue technology to provide solutions in newly developing areas such as computer-telephony integration. Voice portals, which provide a speech-based interface between a telephone user and Web-based services, are the most recent application of spoken dialogue technology. This article describes the main components of the technology—speech recognition, language understanding, dialogue management, communication with an external source such as a database, language generation, speech synthesis—and shows how these component technologies can be integrated into a spoken dialogue system. The article describes in detail the methods that have been adopted in some well-known dialogue systems, explores different system architectures, considers issues of specification, design, and evaluation, reviews some currently available dialogue development toolkits, and outlines prospects for future development.},

A WOz study was carried out with 34 children of ages 7 to 9 in order to find out the most intuitive movements for game controls and to evaluate the relationship between avatar and player actions. Our study extends the previous Wizard of Oz studies by showing that WOz prototyping of perceptive action games is feasible despite the delay caused by the wizard. The results also show that distinctive movement categories and gesture patterns can be found by observing the children playing games controlled by a human wizard. The approach minimizes the need for fully functional prototypes in the early stages of the design and provides video material for testing and developing computer vision algorithms, as well as guidelines for animating the game character.},

abstract = {(from the book) This book provides a . . . critique of a wide range of views in modern cognitive science and the philosophy of mind, from A. Turing's famous test for intelligence in machines to recent work in computational linguistic theory. While discussing many of the key arguments and topics, the authors also develop a distinctive analytic approach. Drawing on the methods of conceptual analysis first elaborated by L. Wittgenstein and G. Ryle, the authors seek to show that these methods still have a great deal to offer in the field of the cognitive theory and the philosophy of mind, providing a powerful alternative to many of the positions put forward in the contemporary literature. Among the many issues discussed in the book are the following: the Cartesian roots of modern conceptions of mind; the nature of A. Turing's test; H. Putnam's functionalist philosophy of mind; J. Searle's 'Chinese Room' thought experiment; J. Fodor's 'language of thought' hypothesis; the place of 'folk psychology' within cognitivist thought; and the question of whether any machine might be said to 'think' or 'understand' in the ordinary senses of these words. This book represents a major intervention in contemporary debates about the status of cognitive science and the nature of mind. It will be of particular interest to students and scholars in philosophy, psychology, linguistics and the computing sciences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

To begin with, the nascent field of HCI followed the scientific method borrowing theories from cognitive science to test theories about user performance at the interface. But HCI has emerged as an eclectic interdiscipline rather than a well-defined science. It now covers all aspects of human life, from birth to bereavement, through all manner of computing, from device ecologies to nano-technology. It comes as no surprise that the role of theory in HCI has also greatly expanded from the early days of scientific testing to include other functions such as describing, explaining, critiquing, and as the basis for generating new designs. The book charts the theoretical developments in HCI, both past and present, reflecting on how they have shaped the field.

In this study, we measure effects of interrupting a user at different moments within task execution in terms of task performance, emotional state, and social attribution. Task models were developed using event perception techniques, and the resulting models were used to identify interruption timings based on a user's predicted cognitive load. Our results show that different interruption moments have different impacts on user emotional state and positive social attribution, and suggest that a system could enable a user to maintain a high level of awareness while mitigating the disruptive effects of interruption. We discuss implications of these results for the design of an attention manager.},

The study provides implications for the design of car-based collaborative media and considers how hands- and eyesfree natural interfaces could be tailored to the complexity of activities in the car and on the road.},

abstract = {Smart homes equipped with ambient intelli- gence technology constitute a promising direction to enable the growing number of elderly to continue to live in theirown home as long as possible. However, this calls for techno- logical solutions that suit their specific needs and capabili- ties. The SWEET-HOME project aims at developing a new user friendly technology for home automation based on voice command. This paper reports a user evaluation assessing the acceptance and fear of this new technology. Eight healthy persons between 71 and 88 years old, 7 relatives (child, grandchild or friend) and 3 professional carers participated in a user evaluation. During about 45 min, the persons were questioned in co-discovery in the DOMUS smart home alter- nating between interview and wizard ofOz periods followed by a debriefing. The experience aimed at testing four important aspects of the project: voice command, commu- nication with the outside world, domotics system interrupt- ing a person's activity, and electronic agenda. Voice interface appeared to have a great potential to ease daily living for elderly and frail persons and would be better accepted than more intrusive solutions. By considering still healthy and independent elderly people in the user evalua- tion, an interesting finding that came up is their overall acceptance provided the system does not drive them to a lazy lifestyle by taking control of everything. This particular fear must be addressed for the development of smart homes that support daily living by giving them more ability to control rather than putting them away from the daily routine.},

abstract = {This article is concerned with understanding situations in which speakers talk in the presence of scientific inscriptions (lectures in science classes, public presentations). Drawing on extensive video materials accumulated in middle and high school science classrooms and university lectures, we develop a framework for the resources speakers make available to their audience for understanding what the talk is about. We distinguish three situations according to the nature of reference to the pehnomenon talked about: (i) talk is about pehnomenon but mediated by reference to a two-dimensional (2-D) inscription; (ii) talk is about phenomenon but mediated by reference to a three-dimensional (3-D) inscription; and (iii) talk is directly about phenomenon. Associated with these three situations are different body orientations, distances from inscriptions, and type of gestures. When speakers laminate talk characteristic of two different types of situations, the orientation "up" can become "down" and "down" can become "up," potentially leading to confusing statements.},

abstract = {Voice interactions on mobile phones are most often used to augment or supplement touch based interactions for users' convenience. However, for people with limited hand dexterity caused by various forms of motor-impairments voice interactions can have a significant impact and in some cases even enable independent interaction with a mobile device for the first time. For these users, a Mobile Voice User Interface (M-VUI), which allows for completely hands-free, voice only interaction would provide a high level of accessibility and independence. Implementing such a system requires research to address long standing usability challenges introduced by voice interactions that negatively affect user experience due to difficulty learning and discovering voice commands. In this paper we address these concerns reporting on research conducted to improve the visibility and learnability of voice commands of a M-VUI application being developed on the Android platform. Our research confirmed long standing challenges with voice interactions while exploring several methods for improving the onboarding and learning experience. Based on our findings we offer a set of implications for the design of M-VUIs.},

The model aims to enable simulation of multimodal human-computer interaction for automatic usability evaluation. The experimental results indicate that modality efficiency and input performance are important moderators of modality choice. Accordingly, we establish a utility-driven model that provides probability estimations of modality usage, based on the parameters of modality efficiency and input performance. Four variants of the model that differ in training data are fitted by means of Sequential Least Squares Programming. The analysis reveals a considerable fit regarding averaged modality usage. When applied to individual modality usage profiles, the accuracy decreases significantly. In an application example it is shown how the modality choice mechanism can be deployed for simulating interaction in the field of automatic usability evaluation. Results and possible limitations are discussed.},

Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing increasingly significant roles in our lives and in the basic infrastructures of science, business, and social interaction. For human-computer interaction to advance in the new millennium we need to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction in which the focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into a complex networked world of information and computer-mediated interactions. We think the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play in understanding interactions between people and technologies, for its focus has always been on whole environments: what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them. Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing and supporting human-computer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we propose distributed cognition as a new foundation for human-computer interaction, sketch an integrated research framework, and use selections from our earlier work to suggest how this framework can provide new opportunities in the design of digital work materials.},

Boundaries and models are ways of imposing metaphorical order on experiental chaos and are provisional, being discarded when their usefulness is exhausted. The need for cross-disciplinary perspectives in language studies is imposed by the nature of an object of study instantiated in human behaviour or human mental processes. Applied linguistics distinctively models linguistic practices and is the meeting place for scholars concerned with understanding the linguistic elements of social, psychological, pedagogical, economic or any other activity or belief system. It is argued that applied linguistics shares a position intersecting with neighbouring sciences and with all other sciences, each of which demarcates its own space in contested and shared ground.},

abstract = {Computer science as an engineering discipline has been spectacularly successful. Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls "embodied interaction" -- an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality -- reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.},

abstract = {Smartwatches are widely available and increasingly adopted by consumers. The most common way of interacting with smartwatches is either touching a screen or pressing buttons on the sides. However, such techniques require using both hands. We propose glance awareness and active gaze interaction as alternative techniques to interact with smartwatches. We will describe an experiment conducted to understand the user preferences for visual and haptic feedback on a "glance" at the wristwatch. Following the glance, the users interacted with the watch using gaze gestures. Our results showed that user preferences differed depending on the complexity of the interaction. No clear preference emerged for complex interaction. For simple interaction, haptics was the preferred glance feedback modality.},

The larger context for DIB is that it is the first stage in a process that promotes organizational learning in response to adverse events through the design of novel IT solutions. DIB is based on the theoretical view of distributed cognition and adopts a system-wide view of failures. DIB is both a reactive and a proactive method in that it aims to locate the causes of either actual or potential adverse events by investigating all elements of the system related to a chosen aspect of patient care. It was developed and evolved using a case study approach whereby data on actual and potential adverse events in clinical environments was collected, modeled and analyzed using successive versions of the method. We provide an explanation and overview of the DIB method, and discuss our experiences of applying it in practice via a detailed example. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The study was concerned with the effects of mobile phone conversation on simulated driving in different traffic environments. Forty-eight participants drove a distance of 70 km on a route which led through different environments. The environments were: rural environment with a speed limit of 90 km/h, rural environment with a speed limit of 70 km/h, urban environment of low complexity, urban environment of medium complexity and urban environment of high complexity. The experimental design was mixed with phone mode (handsfree/handheld) as a between-subjects factor and phone use (yes/no) and traffic environment as within-subjects factors. Performance on a peripheral detection task (PDT) - a measure of mental workload - presented while driving, was impaired by mobile phone conversation in all environments. PDT performance was, however, remarkably poor at the complex urban environment, even when the participants were not using the phone. Driving speed was reduced by conversation in all environments for handheld mode, but only in two environments for handsfree mode - the rural environment with a speed limit of 90 km/h and the complex urban environment. The effects on speed could be interpreted as a compensatory effort for the increased mental workload. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Drawing from user reviews of the Echo posted to Amazon.com, this case study explores the degree to which user reviews indicate personification of the device, sociability level of interactions, factors linked with personification, and influences on user satisfaction. Results indicate users experience some degree of uncertainty in how to refer to the device, with over half using the personified name Alexa but most referencing the device with object pronouns. About half include at least some personification. Degree of personification is linked with sociability of interactions, with greater personification co-occurring with more social interactions. Reviewers mentioning multiple member households are more likely to personify the device than reviewers mentioning only the self, the elderly, or disabled populations. Even after controlling for technical issues, personification predicts user satisfaction with Echo. Author},

We set out to understand how the mobile web was currently fitting into people's lives and what web sessions looked like. Finding a dramatic reduction in mobile web revisi-tation rates compared to previous work and that a large number of sessions comprised single page views, we then studied how web content was shared with others in mobile messaging, the source of many single page sessions. The HCI community has not heavily studied this sharing activity that many people perform daily.

@book{Harper2010a,
abstract = {I think one can say something about where we have come from, how we got here, and where we might go in the future. I think that what needs to be said has to do with our desire to communicate and express, a relationship between this and our ability to devise and exploit new technologies that foster and enable that same expression, and a philosophy about what it means to be human in this day and age. The purpose of this book is to explore these issues. It seems to me that there is a conundrum to be explored that has to do with the tension between communications overload and the desire for communication, between the boredom that older technologies of communication induce and the fascination that exploring the properties of new ones cultivates, and the possibility that communication imposes on us a need to respond, to act, to answer the expressions of others. This tension lies at the heart of our current circumstances. Analysis of how we got here, how technological innovations and socially creative ways of exploiting technology interact, how the delight experienced in using new expressive forms of communication is counteracted by the vexation that the resulting moral burdens place on us-all of this can provide the basis for insights into what it means to be alive, connected, and expressive and into where we might want to be at the end of the next decade and in the years thereafter. The conundrum at the heart of this book is not simply whether we have reached a point of communications overload. I will argue that our experience of communications richness and variation does not lead us to redefine the metaphysics of human nature in just this way, although it ought to lead us to reflect on what our communicative performances achieve. This book allows me to comment on these concerns without coming to a fixed judgment. My reflections are designed to enable readers to form their own views. My purpose is to explain how the technologies of communication are the means whereby we invigorate, shape, and alter the very experiences of what it is to be human. In this view, we are, to some degree, what we say, but we change as we invent new ways of doing the saying. Whether we ought to condemn our choices (as the consumer theorists imply) or whether we should reconfigure our sense of self (as the social psychologists say) is not a question that I answer directly-although I hope to offer reasons and evidence about what the answers (if answers are to be found) might require. It is for readers to make judgments. If my thesis is right, then they are casting themselves in new light as they express. It is for them to ask who they want to be and, beyond this, what kind of society they want to help create. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

@inproceedings{Malone1990,
abstract = {It is possible to design cooperative work tools based only on “common sense” and good intuitions. But the history of technology is replete with examples of good theories greatly aiding the development of useful technology. Where, then, might we look for theories to help us design computer-supported cooperative work tools? In this paper, we will describe one possible perspective—the interdisciplinary study of coordination—that focuses, in part, on how people work together now and how they might do so differently with new information technologies. In one sense, there is little that is new about the study of coordination. Many different disciplines—including computer science, sociology, political science, management science, systems theory, economics, linguistics, and psychology—have all dealt, in one way or another, with fundamental questions about coordination. Furthermore, several previous writers have suggested that theories about coordination are likely to be important for designing cooperative work tools (e.g., [Holt88], [Wino86]). We hope to suggest here, however, that the potential for fruitful interdisciplinary connections concerning coordination is much greater than has as yet been widely appreciated. For instance, we believe that fundamentally similar coordination phenomena arise—unrecognized as such—in many of the fields listed above. Though a single coherent body of theory about coordination does not yet exist, many different disciplines could both contribute to and benefit from more general theories of coordination. Of particular interest to researchers in the field of computer-supported cooperative work is the prospect of drawing on a much richer body of existing and future work in these fields than has previously been suggested. In this paper, we will first describe what we mean by “coordination theory” and give examples of how previous research on computer-supported cooperative work can be interpreted from this perspective. We will then suggest one way of developing this perspective further by proposing tentative definitions of coordination and analyzing its components in more detail.},

We conducted a design exercise and online survey to map the design space of interventions for smartphone non-use and distilled these into a small tax-onomy of intervention categories. Using these findings, we implemented " MyTime, " an intervention to support people in achieving goals related to smartphone non-use. We con-ducted a deployment study with 23 participants over two weeks and found that participants reduced their time with the apps they feel are a poor use of time by 21{\%} while their use of the apps they feel are a good use of time remained un-changed. We found that a small taxonomy describes users' diverse set of desired behavior changes relating to smartphone non-use, and that these desired changes predict: 1) the hypothetical features they are interested in trying, 2) the extent to which they engage with these features in prac-tice, and 3) their changes in behavior in response to the in-tervention. We link users' desired behaviors to the categories of our design taxonomy, providing a foundation for a theo-retical model of designing for smartphone non-use.},

abstract = {In this article, I take the view that it is through local management of talk that knowledge and competence can be modified, and it is through longitudinal participation in the same speech exchange system that further efficiency can be achieved in the next local management of talk. Thus, a longitudinal understanding needs to be situated in local moments, and the interpretation of local moments is inadequate as an account of the participants' perspectives without taking into consideration their longitudinal experience. Given that this line of research has not been much explored within conversation analysis (CA), the current study attempts to look at sequence organization as both a local and longitudinal interactional accomplishment. The data come from a larger long-term study of interactional competence development among novice pharmacists in the United States, and include 21 naturally occurring patient consultations performed by one pharmacy intern. Conversation analysis of her interaction with patients over the course of two months reveals how she changed with respect to (a) the ordering of actions, (b) the organization of openings and advice sequences, and (c) the transitioning from one action to the next. The article concludes with implications for CA and research on workplace socialization.},

Using the third season of Downton Abbey as a case study, we followed 2,234 live-tweeters from the show's premiere episode to its finale, finding that nearly a third of users returned each week to tweet. Semi-structured interviews with 11 diverse live-tweeters revealed that the decision to live-tweet is dependent upon a variety of personal considerations and social conventions forming around this emerging TV viewing practice. This includes the desire to feel connected to a larger community that is interested in the show. Participants actively sought to protect the user experience of others by following good live-tweeting "etiquette", including limiting their number of posts and censoring content that might spoil the show for others. Over time, live-tweeting helped users build and maintain a network of fellow Downton Abbey viewers with shared interests.},

These initial results seek to address the when, who and what of situated mobile phone use – beginning with understanding the impact of context. We then characterise three key modes of use found in the data: micro-breaks, digital knitting and reading. Finally we consider the multi-party and shared nature of phone use and who is involved.

Findings inform existing approaches to design where certain presuppositions regarding the nature of interruption prevail. Accordingly, we propose an approach to interruption handling that respects the ways in which people orient to and reason about interruptions locally in the conduct of situated action.},

The book is often discussed with reference to ethnographic fieldwork, sometimes being cited as if it were a field study. However, the book uses examples from a laboratory study and contains criticisms of ethnography. This article explores how and why Suchman carried out a laboratory study. Based upon this exploration, it argues that social analysis in HCI does not necessitate fieldwork outside the laboratory. More broadly, the paper argues that an appreciation of Plans and Situated Actions can help in moving towards forms of social analysis that span both the laboratory and the world outside. If there is to be a “turn to the wild” in HCI, this should not be a turn away from the laboratory but a turn away from research methods that ignore human practice. This is not to defend laboratory experiments, but to defend laboratory-based studies that explicate technology in practice.},

abstract = {With new computer technologies portable devices are rapidly approaching the dimensions and characteristics of traditional pen and paper-based tools. Text and graphic documents are now commonly viewed using small tablet computers. We conducted a study with small groups of participants to better understand how paper-based text and graphics are used by small collaborative groups as compared to how these groups make use of documents presented on a digital tablet with digital styluses. Our results indicate that digital tools, as compared to paper tools, can affect the levels of verbal communication and participant gaze engagement with other group members. Additionally, we observed how participants spatially arranged paper-based and digital tools during collaborative group activities, how often they switched from digital to paper, and how they still prefer paper overall.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing is unusual amongst technological research arenas. Most areas of computer science research, such as programming language imple- mentation, distributed operating system design, or de- notational semantics, are defined largely by technical problems, and driven by building upon and elaborating a body of past results. Ubiquitous computing, by con- trast, encompasses a wide range of disparate techno- logical areas brought together by a focus upon a common vision. It is driven, then, not so much by the problems of the past but by the possibilities of the fu- ture. Ubiquitous computing's vision, however, is over a decade old at this point, and we now inhabit the future imagined by its pioneers. The future, though, may not have worked out as the field collectively imagined. In this article, we explore the vision that has driven the ubiquitous computing research agenda and the con- temporary practice that has emerged. Drawing on cross- cultural investigations of technology adoption, we argue for developing a ‘‘ubicomp of the present'' which takes the messiness of everyday life as a central theme.},

abstract = {Mobile phones are the most successful computer-based consumer product of the age and yet very little is known about how mobile technology is changing the way people interact and cooperate with each other, and how this change can be analysed. For the first time, Wireless Worldbrings together experts from different disciplines to explore the social factors that are shaping the wireless world and provides an overview of the issues for anyone designing, testing or studying mobile devices. It identifies the major trends, discusses the main claims made about the mobile age, and looks at the issues that affect design, usability and evaluation. A valuable reference for anyone concerned with the future of mobile communications, this book will be of particular interest to advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students on Mobile Technology courses, practitioners, and researchers working in mobile communications, CSCW and HCI. "...an inspired and insightful collection of observations of the use of mobile technology...a valuable resource for both researchers and designers alike." Marge Eldridge, Xerox Research Centre Europe, UK "Working with the speed of the technologies they study, these researchers and product developers provide a rare opportunity to understand the cultural and social effects of a new technology as it emerges, rather than waiting decades for historical and sociological accounts." Jonathan Grudin, Microsoft Research, US "..looks in depth and detail about how people actually use mobiles: how they assemble their lives and re-assemble technologies to fit them.

This paper reports some of the findings from the first phase of the project. The most recent additions to the TV audience are being contributed by the lower socio-economic levels; TV is exerting an apparent over-all effect on other leisure time activities, although this result may be misleading since the impact is not uniform for various segments of the audience; to young children television is not a substitute activity but something over and above the regular activity patterns. Finally, there is evidence that television is responsible for new family interests and widened circles of friends.},

This textbook provides a lucid and integrative analysis of the central topics in pragmatics - deixis, implicature, presupposition, speech acts, and conversational structure. A central concern of the book is the relation between pragmatics and semantics, and Dr Levinson shows clearly how a pragmatic approach can resolve some of the problems semantics have been confronting and simplifying semantic analyses. The exposition is always clear and supported by helpful exemplification. The detailed analyses of selected topics give the student a clear view of the empirical rigour demanded by the study of linguistic pragmatics, but Dr Levinson never loses sight of the rich diversity of the subject. An introduction and conclusion relate pragmatics to other fields in linguistics and other disciplines concerned with language usage - psychology, philosophy, anthropology and literature.},

Recently, there has been a surge of interest within the computational linguistics (CL) community in the social dimension of language. In this article we present a survey of the emerging field of ”computa- tional sociolinguistics" that reflects this increased interest. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of CL research on sociolinguistic themes, featuring topics such as the relation between language and social identity, language use in social interaction, and multilingual communi- cation. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for synergy between the research communities involved, by showing how the large-scale data-driven methods that are widely used in CL can complement existing sociolinguistic studies, and how sociolinguistics can inform and challenge the methods and assumptions used in CL studies. We hope to convey the possible benefits of a closer collaboration between the two communities and conclude with a discussion of open challenges.},

The correlation analysis shows that the motives of smartphone use were positively related to bonding relations but negatively related to bridging relations. The hierarchical multiple regression analysis finds the associations among motives of smartphone use, social relations, perceived social support, and variables of psychological well-being. The results demonstrate that needs for caring for others were negatively related to loneliness and depression and positively related to self-esteem. However, the communication motives are not a significant predictor to determine self-esteem, loneliness, and depression. In addition, bonding and bridging social relations and social support significantly increase self-esteem and decrease loneliness and depression.},

abstract = {This paper describes our recent work in developing multilingual spoken language systems that support human-computer interactions. Our approach is based on the premise that a common semantic representation can be extracted from the input for all languages, at least within the context of restricted domains. In our design of such systems, language dependent information is separated from the system kernel as much as possible, and encoded in external data structures. The internal system manager, discourse and dialogue component, and database are all maintained in a language transparent form. Our description will focus on the development of the multilingual MIT Voyager spoken language system, which can engage in verbal dialogues with users about a geographical region within Cambridge, MA in the USA. The system can provide information about distances, travel times or directions between objects located within this area (e.g., restaurants, hotels, banks, libraries), as well as information such as the addresses, telephone numbers or location of the objects themselves. Voyager has been fully ported to Japanese and Italian, and we are in the process of porting to French and German as well. Evaluations for the English, Japanese and Italian systems are reported. Other related multilingual research activities are also briefly mentioned. ?? 1995.},

The aircraft's motion is affected by other factors, besides the pilot controls in the form of external disturbances, such as wind, and internal errors, due to unmodelled dynamics, tracking error and system noise. Navigation equipment tracks the exact real-time location of the aircraft in 4D space and provides feedback to both the pilot in the cockpit and ATC via ADS-B. ATM was expressed as a large, decentralized, dynamic, variable size, infinite horizon, multi-parameter, constrained, nonlinear, non-causal, non-convex, multi-objective, high-dimensionality, hybrid (continuous and combinatorial), optimal control problem. Rapidly increasing growth and demand in CNS/ATM, the advanced scheme for ATM, ADS-B system which is based on digital communication is being implemented in the field of surveillance. ADS-B is a radically new technology that is redefining the paradigm of CNS in ATM today. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is the next generation air surveillance system which supplants and complements the limitations of conventional radar, since conventional ATM radar systems will reach their limits soon due to the increases in air traffic.},

Single-task conditions required only tapping or naming. When a verbal naming response was required (Experiment 1) additivity between tapping and naming was obtained for single- vs. dual-task comparisons and for only dual-task comparisons. When the naming response was made by moving a lever (Experiment 2) the additivity for only dual-task comparisons remained while an interaction was obtained for single- vs. dual-task comparisons.

abstract = {In an age of ever-increasing technological innovation, this renowned volume - which has sold more than 30,000 copies in each edition - is more important than ever. DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS lucidly explains how inventions are almost always perceived as uncertain or even risky. To overcome this, most people seek out others like themselves who have already adopted the new idea. The diffusion process, then, is most often shaped by a few individuals who spread the word amongst their circle of acquaintances, a process that typically takes months or years. But there are exceptions: use of the Internet in the 1990s, for instance, may have spread more rapidly than any other innovation in human history - and it continues to influence the very nature of diffusion by decreasing the significance of physical distance between people. As thought- provoking as it is instructive, this fully updated, widely acclaimed work of scholarship is itself a great idea that continues to spread.},

abstract = {Volunteer socializers are members of a community who voluntarily help newcomers become familiar with the popular practices and attitudes of the community. In this paper, we explore the social and psychological predictors of volunteer socializers on reddit, an online social news- sharing community. Through a survey of over 1000 reddit users, we found that social identity, prosocial-orientation and generalized reciprocity are all predictors of socializers in the community. Interestingly, a user's tenure with the online community has a quadratic effect on volunteer socialization behaviors—new and long-time members are both more likely to help newcomers than those in between. We conclude with design implications for motivating users to help newcomers.},

Participants were 40 Canadians and 40 Chinese who formed 40 dyads in four experimental conditions: Canadian speaker-Canadian listener, Chinese speaker-Chinese listener, Chinese speaker-Canadian listener, and Canadian speaker-Chinese listener. All conversations were videotaped and microanalyzed.The data generated four findings: (a) In the Chinese speaker-Chinese listener interactions, coopera- tive interruptions occurred more frequently than intrusive interruptions; (b) when Cana- dians served as doctors, the doctors performed significantly more intrusive interruptions than cooperative ones; (c) the two intercultural groups engaged in more unsuccessful interruptions than the two intracultural groups; and (d) in the intercultural conditions, the occurrences of intrusive interruptions were greater than cooperative interruptions. This phenomenon provides unequivocal support for communication accommodation the- ory. The findings point to a hypothesis that conversational interruption may be a pan- cultural phenomenon, whereas interruption styles may be culture specific.},

Although doctors most frequently select children as problem presenters, parents are the most likely to actually present the child's problem. However, parents nonetheless orient to their children's rights to answer question that select them as next speaker. Thus, the actual problem presenter emerges as the result of a process of interactional negotiation rather than dominance or control. This study also suggests communication resources that may increase the child's participation in presenting the problem},

One successful approach has been to deploy instrumented applications, logging their use over long periods of time. We present an expansion of this by remotely recording video and audio of use, while also capturing device and app context. In vivo combines five data collection techniques - screen recording, ambient audio recording, wearable cameras, data logging and distributed remote uploads. This data provides a range of insights and we discuss examples from previous work which reveal interaction design issues where interface confusions or task mismatches occur. We see how apps are integrated into ongoing activity and environment (such as how maps are used in situ), and how recorded conversations around and about apps may be used for evaluation purposes. We conclude by arguing that this combinative method helps us to move from considering app use in isolation, to studying app use in interaction.},

In addition to manipulating ringer volume, vibration, and phone alerts, SenSay can provide remote callers with the ability to communicate the urgency of their calls, make call suggestions to users when they are idle, and provide the caller with feedback on the current status of the Sensay user. A number of sensors including accelerometers, light, and microphones are mounted at various points on the body to provide data about the user's context. A decision module uses a set of rules to analyze the sensor data and manage a state machine composed of uninterruptible, idle, active and normal states. Results from our threshold analyses show a clear delineation can be made among several user states by examining sensor data trends. SenSay augments its contextual knowledge by tapping into applications such as electronic calendars, address books, and task lists. The phone alleviates cognitive load on users by various methods including detecting when the user is uninterruptible and automatically turning the ringer off.},

For example, a group of students could sit around an interactive table and search for digital images to use in a report. We have developed TeamSearch, an application that enables this type of activity by supporting group specification of Boolean style queries. We explore whether TeamSearch should consider all group members' activities as contributing to a single query or should interpret them as separate, parallel search requests. The results reveal that both strategies are similarly efficient, but that collective query formation has advantages in terms of enhancing group collaboration and awareness, allowing users to bootstrap query specification skills, and personal preference. This suggests that team centric ills may offer benefits beyond the "staples" of efficiency and result quality that are usually considered when designing search interfaces.},

abstract = {Adaptive personalization, where the system adapts the interface to a user's needs, has the potential for significant performance benefits on small screen devices. However, research on adaptive interfaces has almost exclusively focused on desktop displays. To explore how well previous findings generalize to small screen devices, we conducted a study with 36 subjects to compare adaptive interfaces for small and desktop-sized screens. Results show that high accuracy adaptive menus have an even larger positive impact on performance and satisfaction when screen real estate is constrained. The drawback of the high accuracy menus, however, is that they reduce the user's awareness of the full set of items in the interface, potentially making it more difficult for users to learn about new features.},

abstract = {In computer systems design, ethnomethodology is seen as a form of ethnography that emphasises situated work practices and the workplace. However, designers have increasingly taken an interest in developing systems to support non-work matters such as social networking, gaming, and fun, and non-work settings such as the home. Some have, therefore, suggested that ethnography driven by interests in work practice is not relevant for these new developments because they do not involve matters of work, and that, consequently, a new form of ethnography is required. This paper critically addresses this argument and contends that ethnography can be analytically grounded in ethnomethodology as a ubiquitous method for building 'the social' into systems design. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Dictation using speech recognition could potentially serve as an efficient input method for touchscreen devices. However, dictation systems today follow a mentally disruptive speech interaction model: users must first formulate utterances and then produce them, as they would with a voice recorder. Because utterances do not get transcribed until users have finished speaking, the entire output appears and users must break their train of thought to verify and correct it. In this paper, we introduce Voice Typing, a new speech interaction model where users' utterances are transcribed as they produce them to enable real-time error identification. For fast correction, users leverage a marking menu using touch gestures. Voice Typing aspires to create an experience akin to having a secretary type for you, while you monitor and correct the text. In a user study where participants composed emails using both Voice Typing and traditional dictation, they not only reported lower cognitive demand for Voice Typing but also exhibited 29{\%} relative reduction of user corrections. Overall, they also preferred Voice Typing.},

abstract = {Abstract The debate over the social use of the mobile phone has been enriched by a large amount of information and reflection as to how this instrument has modified interpersonal relations, changed roles in the family, re‐defined the limits of communicative possibilities, rewritten the present functioning of institutions such as hospitals and schools, as well as the modus operandi of criminal organizations, intensified work rhythms, rationalized the organization of work relations, in a word, how the use of the mobile has profoundly changed society.2 On the contrary, less attention has been dedicated to the reconstruction and analysis of the impulse that its users have given the mobile (see its unexpected transformation, from the king of orality to a means of writing and reading). The main thesis of this article is that the mobile is changing not only society, but above all the framework in which society lives. This framework is made up of space and time as its primary determinations, which are able to integrate, stabilize and structure reality. The mobile changes reality in its widest sense, or rather its social representation. Let us remember with McLuhan (1964), Meyrowitz (1985) and many other scholars, that the medium is not only the message, but also a specific concept of time and space, that is, a specific dimension of existence. In the following sections, above all the changes that have been brought about to space and time will be dealt with, and then how the statute of the presence and absence of individuals in social space is modified will be analysed, how the relation between modern citizens changes radically with public space, and finally how the democratic process is enriched by further implementations.},

This study examines the effect of anticipation and origin (i.e. instant messaging, or phone and intercom) of an interruption on user web performance on a mobile device (iPAQ h3800 pocket PC) or desktop computer. Results show that instant messages can significantly disrupt web task performance time, contrary to popular belief that phones are more disruptive. Anticipated interruptions produce better web task performance particularly on a mobile platform. As expected, web tasks take 1.5 times longer to complete during interruptions on an iPAQ compared to a desktop. INTRODUCTION},

Research on mobile collocated interactions has been looking at situations in which collocated users engage in collaborative activities using their mobile devices, thus going from personal/individual toward shared/multiuser experiences and interactions. However, computers are getting smaller, more powerful, and closer to our bodies. Therefore, mobile collocated interactions research, which originally looked at smartphones and tablets, will inevitably include ever-smaller computers, ones that can be worn on our wrists or other parts of the body. The focus of this workshop is to bring together a community of researchers, designers and practitioners to explore the potential of extending mobile collocated interactions to the use of wearable devices.},

abstract = {When on the move, cognitive resources are reserved partly for passively monitoring and reacting to contexts and events, and partly for actively constructing them. The Resource Competition Framework (RCF), building on the Multiple Resources Theory, explains how psychosocial tasks typical of mobile situations compete for cognitive resources and then suggests that this leads to the depletion of resources for task interaction and eventually results in the breakdown of fluent interaction. RCF predictions were tested in a semi-naturalistic field study measuring attention during the performance of assigned Web search tasks on mobile phone while moving through nine varied but typical urban situations. Notably, we discovered up to eight-fold differentials between micro-level measurements of attentional resource fragmentation, for example from spans of over 16 seconds in a laboratory condition dropping to bursts of just a few seconds in difficult mobile situations. By calibrating perceptual sampling, reducing resources from tasks of secondary importance, and resisting the impulse to switch tasks before finalization, participants compensated for the resource depletion. The findings are compared to previous studies in office contexts. The work is valuable in many areas of HCI dealing with mobility.},

abstract = {While surgical practices are increasingly reliant on a range of digital imaging technologies, the ability for clinicians to interact and manipulate these digital representations in the operating theatre using traditional touch based interaction devices is constrained by the need to maintain sterility. To overcome these concerns with sterility, a number of researchers are have been developing ways of enabling interaction in the operating theatre using touchless interaction techniques such as gesture and voice to allow clinicians control of the systems. While there have been important technical strides in the area, there has been little in the way of understanding the use of these touchless systems in practice. With this in mind we present a touchless system developed for use during vascular surgery. We deployed the system in the endovascular suite of a large hospital for use in the context of real procedures. We present findings from a study of the system in use focusing on how, with touchless interaction, the visual resources were embedded and made meaningful in the collaborative practices of surgery. In particular we discuss the importance of direct and dynamic control of the images by the clinicians in the context of talk and in the context of other artefact use as well as the work performed by members of the clinical team to make themselves sensable by the system. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for how we think about the design, evaluation and use of these systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Data was gathered through observations and interviews, and then analysed using DiCoT and the Resources Model to construct models representing the social structures, information flows, physical layouts and artefact use involved in infusion administration in the ICU. The findings of the study confirm that DCog can be a methodology of choice for studying healthcare work: nurses collaborated significantly, artefacts played a major role in coordinating activity, and the physical environment influenced activity properties which DCog effectively supports reasoning about.},

abstract = {Ownership and use of multiple devices such as desktop com-puters, smartphones, and tablets is increasing rapidly. Search is popular and people often perform search tasks that span device boundaries. Understanding how these devices are used and how people transition between them during infor-mation seeking is essential in developing search support for a multi-device world. In this paper, we study search across devices and propose models to predict aspects of cross-device search transitions. We characterize multi-device search across four device types, including aspects of search behavior on each device (e.g., topics of interest) and characteristics of de-vice transitions. Building on the characterization, we learn models to predict various aspects of cross-device search, in-cluding the next device used for search. This enables many applications. For example, accurately forecasting the device used for the next query lets search engines proactively re-trieve device-appropriate content (e.g., short documents for smartphones), while knowledge of the current device com-bined with device-specific topical interest models may assist in better query-sense disambiguation.},

Stroop and control stimuli were presented individually in order to vary task pacing. Subjects (N = 48) were divided into three groups assigned to self-paced, externally-paced, and fast externally-paced conditions. Performance data revealed that the relative proportion of speed and accuracy reductions which resulted from the Stroop interference varied according to task pacing and pacing speed. Stroop performance was accompanied by heightened HR levels which were sustained throughout the series. State-Anxiety scores increased after both tasks, but only among subjects who completed a large number of trials, i.e. subjects in the self-paced and fast externally-paced groups. Skin conductance responses only varied according to task order and time within series, irrespective of Stroop interference or task pacing. Overall, the results remained in accordance with an effort account of the relationship between attention and cardiac activity. They also provided indications on how the Stroop test may act as an efficient laboratory stressor.},

abstract = {The title of this paper comes from comments made by an ‘angry' ethnographer during a debriefing session. It reflects his frustration with a certain analytic mentality that would have him justify his observations in terms of the number of times he had witnessed certain occurrences in the field. Concomitant to this was a concern with the amount of time he had spent in the field and the implication that the duration of fieldwork somehow justified the things that he had seen; the implication being that the more time he spent immersed in the study setting the more valid his findings and, conversely, the less time, the less valid they were. For his interlocutors, these issues speak to the grounds upon which we might draw general insights and lessons from ethnographic research regarding the social or collaborative organisation of human activities. However, the strong implication of the angry ethnographer's response is that they are of no importance. This paper seeks to unpack his position and explicate what generalisation turns upon from the ethnographer's perspective. The idea that human activities contain their own means of generalisation that cannot be reduced to extraneous criteria (numbers of observations, duration of fieldwork, sample size, etc.) is key to the exposition},

Moreover, it considers how the concept, `intercorporeality' could be used to effect a new reading of his work.

In this paper, we focus on a particular aspect of awareness, the ways in which participants design actiheathvities to have others unobtrusively notice and discover, actions and events, which might otherwise pass unnoticed. We consider for example how participants render visible selective aspects of their activities, how they encourage others to notice features of the local milieu, and how they encourage others to become sensitive to particular events. We draw examples from different workplaces, primarily centres of coordination; organisational environments which rest upon the participants' abilities to delicately interweave a complex array of highly contingent, yet interdependent activities.},

However, standard usability heuristics are hard to apply as IT security management occurs within a complex and collaborative context that involves diverse stakeholders. We propose a set of ITSM usability heuristics that are based on activity theory, are supported by prior research, and consider the complex and cooperative nature of security management. In a between-subjects study, we compared the employment of the ITSM and Nielsen's heuristics for evaluation of a commercial identity management system. Participants who used the ITSM set found more problems categorized as severe than those who used Nielsen's. As evaluators identified different types of problems with the two sets of heuristics, we recommend employing both the ITSM and Nielsen's heuristics during evaluation of ITSM tools.},

abstract = {The HOP1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is important for meiotic chromosomal pairing, because hop1 diploids fall to form synaptonemal complex during meiosis and are defective in crossing over between, but not within, chromosomes. We demonstrate here that the HOP1 gene is transcriptionally regulated during sporulation and that the HOP1 protein is situated along the lengths of meiotic chromosomes. Furthermore, the HOP1 protein contains a Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger motif. A mutation within this motif that changes a cysteine to serine results in the hop1 phenotype, consistent with the possibility that the HOP1 gene product acts in chromosome synapsis by directly interacting with DNA. These observations demonstrate that HOP1 encodes a component of meiotic chromosomes, perhaps serving as a constituent of the synaptonemal complex. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Multimodal conversational spoken dialogues using physical and virtual agents provide a potential interface to motivate and support users in the domain of health and fitness. This paper describes how such multimodal conversational Companions can be implemented to support their owners in various pervasive and mobile settings. We present concrete system architectures, virtual, physical and mobile multimodal interfaces, and interaction management techniques for such Companions. In particular how knowledge representation and separation of low-level interaction modelling from high-level reasoning at the domain level makes it possible to implement distributed, but still coherent, interaction with Companions. The distribution is enabled by using a dialogue plan to communicate information from domain level planner to dialogue management and from there to a separate mobile interface. The model enables each part of the system to handle the same information from its own perspective without containing overlapping logic, and makes it possible to separate task-specific and conversational dialogue management from each other. In addition to technical descriptions, results from the first evaluations of the Companions interfaces are presented. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Collaborative Games are played on mobile devices connected in wireless networks where users can start, join and leave games ad hoc. In a user study, one of these mobile games was made available in a café frequented by high school students for a period of two weeks. During the test period we noted several new forms of interaction emerging, such as players running away with their displays to avoid other players from accessing them. We also found interesting verbal exchanges, such as the use of “me” to refer to both the user's handheld display and her on-screen representation. We believe that these new ways of interaction is a result of using the shared display in a new domain.},

HCI and interaction design practitioners have adopted and used affinity diagrams for different purposes. This paper discusses our particular use of affinity diagramming in prototype evaluations. We reflect on a decade's experience using affinity diagramming across a number of projects, both in industry and academia. Our affinity diagramming process in interaction design has been tailored and consists of four stages: creating notes, clustering notes, walking the wall, and documentation. We draw examples from eight projects to illustrate our particular practices along these four stages, as well as to ground the discussion.},

Alongside the extensive technological developments that are currently taking place, is the emergence of a ‘cottage industry' culture, where a polyphony of new theories, methods and concerns have been imported into the field from a diversity of disciplines and backgrounds. An extensive critique of recent theoretical developments is presented together with what practitioner's currently use. A significant development of importing new theories into the field has been much insightful explication of ‘HCI' phenomena, together with extending the field's discourse. However, at the same time, the theoretically-based approaches have had a limited impact on the practice of interaction design. This chapter discusses why this is so and suggests that different kinds of mechanisms are needed that will enable both designers and researchers to better articulate and theoretically ground the hard challenges facing them today.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: In this study, we sought to examine several measures of anesthesia provider workload during different phases of anesthesia care and during teaching and nonteaching cases. Clinical work was assessed in real-time during 24 general anesthetics performed by consenting anesthesia providers. Workload was measured using physiological (provider heart rate), psychological (self-assessment and observer rating), and procedural (response latency to an alarm light and workload density) techniques. Clinicians' heart rates, observer and self-reported workload scores, and nonteaching workload density were consistently increased during anesthetic induction and emergence compared with maintenance. In nonteaching cases, workload density correlated with heart rate and with psychological workload. Workload density during teaching cases did not decrease during the induction and was significantly greater than during nonteaching cases. Alarm-light response latency (a measure of clinical vigilance) was significantly prolonged during the teaching compared with nonteaching cases. These results suggest that intraoperative teaching increases the workload of the clinician instructor and may reduce vigilance during anesthesia care. Additionally, multiple workload measures may provide a more comprehensive profile of the work demands of clinical cases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPLICATIONS: Psychological, physiological, and procedural workload measures during routine general anesthesia cases documented the increased work demands of induction and emergence. Intraoperative teaching increased workload and decreased vigilance, suggesting the need for caution when educating during patient care.},

abstract = {Desktop notifications are designed to provide awareness of information while a user is attending to a primary task. Unfortunately the awareness can come with the price of disruption to the focal task. We review results of a field study on the use and perceived value of email notifications in the workplace. We recorded users' interactions with software applications for two weeks and studied how notifications or their forced absence influenced users' quest for awareness of new email arrival, as well as the impact of notifications on their overall task focus. Results showed that users view notifications as a mechanism to provide passive awareness rather than a trigger to switch tasks. Turing off notifications cause some users to self interrupt more to explicitly monitor email arrival, while others appear to be able to better focus on their tasks. Users acknowledge notifications as disruptive, yet opt for them because of their perceived value in providing awareness.},

We observed that this is not the reality today, even when devices were in abundance.

They could choose between three different visualization types to answer questions about economic data. Tasks were designed to afford simultaneous use of tablets, either with linked or independent views. We found that users typically utilized only one tablet per user. A quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed a “legacy bias” that introduced barriers for using more tablets and reduced the overall benefit of multi-device visualization.},

abstract = {Rail signalling in the UK has seen a move from mechanical lever frame boxes to entry and exit signalling, and on through to situating signallers within a visual display unit-based workstation environment. These developments have taken place in tandem with changes such as making the signallers more remote from their area of control and the introduction of automation. These changes have implications not only at a cognitive level for factors such as workload and situation awareness , but also at an organizational level, such as the shift away from traditional career progression, and the resulting implications for training and the development of expertise. Understanding the implications of the signalling interface and the design implementation of automation is critical in facilitating more effective performance, safety, and signaller well-being, as well as informing the design of future rail control systems. Bainbridge articulated a set of ironies of automation – unintended consequences of introducing automation that may not be beneficial to the overall system effectiveness. The work presented in this article uses a structured observation approach to examine behavioural indicators of the impact of automation, either as a successful tool to support signalling or as a source of some or all of the ironies noted by Bainbridge. The work was conducted over a period of 2 years, to investigate the effect of levels of automation on rail signallers' activity and workload as part of the EPSRC Rail Research UK B6 programme.},

However, due to voice input errors (such as speech recognition errors and improper system interruptions), users need to frequently reformulate queries to handle the incorrectly recognized queries. We conducted user experiments with native English speakers on their query reformulation behaviors in voice search and found that users often reformulate queries with both lexical and phonetic changes to previous queries. In this paper, we first characterize and analyze typical voice input errors in voice search and users' corresponding reformulation strategies. Then, we evaluate the impacts of typical voice input errors on users' search progress and the effectiveness of different reformulation strategies on handling these errors. This study provides a clearer picture on how to further improve current voice search systems.},

To minimize users attentional overload, we propose a novel middleware "Attelia" that detects breakpoints of user's mobile interactions to deliver notifications adaptively. Attelia detects such timings in real-time, using only users phones, without any external sensors, and without any modifications to applications. Our extensive evaluation proved Attelias effectiveness. In-the-wild user study with 30 participants for 16 days showed that, specifically for the users with greater sensitivity for interruptive notification timings, notification scheduling in Attelia's breakpoint timing reduced users frustration by 28{\%} in users' real smart phone environments.},

In this study, the type of human-computer interface used (standard keyboard/mouse use of menus or keyboard/mouse with a voice front-end) is expected to influence user performance (task completion time and error rates) and satisfaction. The user's novice/expert classification is expected to interact with these two types of interfaces to influence the efficiency of the user's performance. The results suggest that there are significant relationships between task performance and level of expertise/type of interface and between user attitudes and type of interface. In general, the front-end voice interface users performed worse and had less favorable attitudes towards the software tool than the menu interface users. {\textcopyright} 1996 Academic Press Limited.},

@article{Wright2000,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach to interaction modelling based on the concept of information resource. The approach is inspired by recent distributed cognition (DC) literature but develops a model that applies specifically to human-computer interaction (HCI) modelling. There are of course many approaches to modelling HCI and the motivation of this paper is not to offer yet another approach. Rather our motivation is that the recent developments in DC are so obviously relevant to HCI modelling and design yet the ideas have lacked visibility in the HCI community. By providing a model whose concepts are rooted in DC concepts we hope to achieve this visibility. In addition, we hope to provide the foundation for a programme of research that extends the DC analysis of single user systems presented here to larger units of analysis more familiar to CSCW and DC research. DC research identifies resources for action as central to the interaction between people and technologies, but it stops short of providing a definition of such resources at a level that could be used to analyse interaction. The resources model described in this paper defines a limited number of resource types as abstract information structures that can be used to analyse interaction. We demonstrate how these abstract types can be differently represented in an interface and how this affects performance. The paper identifies a number of interaction strategies that utilise different configurations of resources. These two components of the resources model, information structures and interaction strategies, through the process of co-ordination and integration, provide the link between devices, representations and action that is not well articulated in the DC literature.},

@article{Firth1995a,
abstract = {The pragmatic and discursive functions of accounts have been the subject of considerable scholarly attention in recent decades. In their seminal paper,Scott and Lyman (1968)define 'accounts' in a retroactive sense, as "statements made to explain unanticipated or untoward behaviour", and it is overridingly in this regard that accounts have been approached in the literature. However, by attending to the way accounts are interactionally deployed in a single commodity negotiation, it is shown that accounts may also be used in a proactive, creative sense. Accounts, it will be argued, do substantially more than 'explain' behaviour and 'repair' fractured social interaction. By providing a vocabulary of (organizational) motives, by revealing putative 'facts' pertaining to market conditions, and by justifying actions, accounts establish a basis from which organizationally relevant action may be identified, challenged, and discussed. Furthermore, it will be shown that 'accounting' is not only a unilateral act but may, at significant junctures in the negotiation, be undertaken multilaterally. This can be seen in the way negotiators 'share' the activity of accounting as a method of intimating agreement. In sum, accounts provide mutually accessible (discourse) resources that allow negotiators to undertake their work effectively, i.e., to reach substantive agreement. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The system comprises several computers connected in a network, or through WiFi or Bluetooth interfaces. The system software is organized around two multi-agent platforms. The first one, JADE, written in Java is used to integrate agents directly into the toolkits which use Java. The second one, OMAS, written in Lisp is used to implement conversational intelligent agents. The paper discusses the role and the use of both platforms and how they are connected to work together. Although developed in a project addressing collaborative Preliminary Design, the system and its architecture can be used in any application composed of sequences of phases.},
